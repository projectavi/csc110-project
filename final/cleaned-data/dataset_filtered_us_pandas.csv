Most recently, in yet another emergency appeal, the supreme court by a 5-4 margin, refused to block the newly enacted Texas law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, allowing that rule to be enforced for the foreseeable future. The growing support for some or all of these reforms by many non-partisan organizations, academics, and Democratic politicians, is a response to the discontent created by Trump’s unprecedented manipulation of the appointment process for federal judges, designed to ensure that his politics and policies will control the lives of future generations."
2,2,1635120959,"Fauci admitted to downplaying the importance of masks during the first couple of months of the pandemic because there was a PPE shortage among medical personnel and first responders, and it wasn't known whether cloth masks would provide significant protection. The fear was that people might put themselves at risk, believing that their cloth mask or dust mask was protecting them when it really wasn't.

When companies making PPE ramped up and we had evidence that dust masks and cloth masks were effective against the spread of Covid-19, Fauci started urging everyone to wear masks while continuing to do social distancing.

This led the charlatans at Fox News and their idiot viewers to conclude that Fauci was lying just to make Trump look bad. They also seem confused about the whole concept of ""vaccination, masking, and distancing together are more effective than doing just one of these things""."

**For unvaccinated, reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 is likely, study finds**
https://news.yale.edu/2021/10/01/unvaccinated-reinfection-sars-cov-2-likely-study-finds

&gt;Now a team of scientists led by faculty at Yale School of Public Health and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte have an answer: Strong protection following natural infection is short-lived.


&gt;**“Reinfection can reasonably happen in three months or less**,” said Jeffrey Townsend, the Elihu Professor of Biostatistics at the Yale School of Public Health and the study’s lead author. “Therefore, those who have been naturally infected should get vaccinated. Previous infection alone can offer very little long-term protection against subsequent infections.”

&gt;The study, published in the journal The Lancet Microbe, is the first to determine the likelihood of reinfection following natural infection and without vaccination.


&gt;Townsend and his team analyzed known reinfection and immunological data from the close viral relatives of SARS-CoV-2 that cause “common colds,” along with immunological data from SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Leveraging evolutionary principles, the team was able to model the risk of COVID-19 reinfection over time.


&gt;Reinfections can, and have, happened even shortly after recovery, the researchers said. And they will become increasingly common as immunity wanes and new SARS-CoV-2 variants arise."

37,37,1634242840,"Here's the full text of the op-ed:

---

Big business is overwhelmingly in favor of requiring that workers get vaccinated against Covid-19. A recent CNBC survey of chief financial officers found that 80 percent of them say they “totally support” the Biden administration’s plan to impose a vaccine-or-test mandate on companies with more than 100 workers, and many companies have already announced vaccination requirements for their employees.

Yet Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, just issued an executive order banning vaccine mandates in his state. That is, he’s not just refusing to use his own powers to promote vaccination; he’s interfering in private decisions, trying to prevent businesses from requiring that their workers or customers be vaccinated.

And on Sunday, Senator Ted Cruz celebrated a wave of flight cancellations by Dallas-based Southwest Airlines, based on rumors — which both the airline and its union deny — that the problems were caused by a walkout of employees protesting the airline’s new vaccine requirements.

What’s going on here?

Republicans have been closely allied with big business since the Gilded Age, when a party originally based on opposition to slavery was, in effect, captured by the rising power of corporations. That alliance lost some of its force in the 1950s and 1960s, an era in which the G.O.P. largely accepted things like progressive taxation and strong labor unions, but came back in full with the rise of Ronald Reagan and his agenda of tax cuts and deregulation.

Indeed, it wasn’t that long ago that you could plausibly think of the Republican Party as basically a front for big-business interests, one that exploited social issues and appeals to racial hostility to win elections, only to turn immediately after each election to a pro-corporate agenda. That was basically the thesis of Thomas Frank’s 2004 book “What’s the Matter With Kansas,” and it seemed like a good model of the party until the rise of Trumpism.

Now, however, Republican politicians are at odds with corporate America on crucial issues. It’s not just vaccines. Corporate interests also want serious investment in infrastructure and find themselves on the outs with Republican leaders who don’t want to see Democrats achieve any policy successes. Basically, the G.O.P. is currently engaged in a major campaign of sabotage — its leaders want to see America do badly, because they believe this will redound to their political advantage — and if this hurts their corporate backers along the way, they don’t care.

Just to be clear, corporations aren’t being good guys. They support vaccine mandates and infrastructure investment because they believe that both would be good for their bottom lines. They’re still, for the most part, opposed to the rest of the Biden agenda, including — unforgivably — efforts to fight climate change, because they don’t want to pay higher taxes.

Still, the conflict between the G.O.P. and corporations is a striking new turn in American politics. And I wonder if some corporate leaders find themselves asking, in the privacy of their own minds, “My God, what have we done?”

For the truth is that the Republican Party has been growing increasingly radical — and decreasingly rational — for a long time. Where we are now is the culmination of a process that began in the 1990s, when Newt Gingrich became House speaker, if not earlier. Yet corporate interests continued to back the G.O.P. In fact, leading business organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce leaned much further into partisanship even as Republicans became more radical, apparently believing that they could live with a bit of craziness so long as they got their tax cuts and deregulation.

Now they’re learning that they aren’t in control, and in fact have barely any voice in the party they bankrolled. They thought they were using the extremists; it turns out that the extremists were using them.

The question is, what are they going to do about it?"

taxpayers are covering their healthcare in large part city, county, state - and so i hope those political bodies will do what Delta airlines did by raising the workers' monthly cost for healthcare for each unvaccinated family member on the plan.

&gt;How CDC Monitors Breakthrough Infections

&gt;CDC has multiple surveillance systems and ongoing research studies to monitor the performance of vaccines in preventing infection, disease, hospitalization, and death.  CDC also collects data on vaccine breakthrough infections through outbreak investigations. One important system that CDC uses to track vaccine breakthrough infections is COVID-NET (the Coronavirus Disease 2019 [COVID-19]-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network). This system provides the most complete data on vaccine breakthrough in the general population. COVID-NET is a population-based surveillance system that collects reports of lab-confirmed COVID-19-related hospitalizations in 99 counties in 14 states. COVID-NET covers approximately 10% of the U.S. population. One recent COVID-NET publication assessed the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing hospitalization among adults ≥ 65 years. This system provides complete data on vaccine breakthrough hospitalizations in the general population.

There are plenty of Democratic politicians who have opposed Republican voter suppression laws that don't require just IDs, but only extremely specific IDs that they have deliberately made harder to get, or multiple IDs, or multiple copies of IDs, but the name for calling that ""opposing voter ID"" is simple: that's a lie.

Indeed, some surveys suggested that as many as half of unvaccinated workers would quit their jobs rather than take their shots.

But such threats are proving mostly empty. Many state and local governments and a significant number of private employers have already imposed vaccine mandates — and these mandates have been very successful. Compliance has been high, and only a relative handful of workers have quit or had to be fired.

To understand why vaccine mandates seem to work so well, we need to think about the real nature of vaccine resistance. Most of the people refusing to take their shots don’t really believe that the vaccines contain tracking microchips or that they have severe side effects.

Instead, everything we’ve seen suggests that many vaccine resisters are like the people who in the past raged about seatbelt laws and bans on phosphates in detergents, or more recently refused to wear masks. That is, they’re people who balk at being asked to accept what they imagine to be a cost or inconvenience on behalf of the public good. (In reality, getting vaccinated is very much something you should do on purely selfish grounds, but as I’ll explain in a minute, that information may not be getting through.) And as I’ve noticed in the past, political rage about public health rules seems, if anything, to be inversely related to how onerous these rules really are.

The point is that most vaccine resistance isn’t about deep concerns, but it often involves assertions of the right to give (misguided perceptions of) self-interest priority over the public interest. So, luckily, many resisters fold as soon as the calculus of self-interest reverses, and refusing to take their shots has immediate, tangible financial costs.

Let’s back up and talk about why the U.S. vaccination drive stalled — why, after a promising start, we fell behind other advanced countries. And let’s be blunt: The core problem is Republicans.

It’s true that vaccination rates among Black and Hispanic adults initially lagged behind the rest of the population, as did rates among political independents. But those gaps have been rapidly closing. For example, between April and September the vaccinated share of Black adults rose from 51 percent to 70 percent, while that of self-identified Republicans rose only from 52 percent to 58 percent.

The geographical evidence is also stark. Counties that strongly supported Donald Trump have far lower vaccination rates than counties that strongly supported Biden. And since June 30 the Trumpiest tenth of the country has had 5.5 times the Covid death rate of the least Trumpy tenth.

But why have so many Republicans refused to take their shots? Some, of course, have bought into the wild claims about side effects and sinister conspiracies that circulate on social media. But they’re probably a small minority.

Almost surely, mainstream right-wing media outlets, especially Fox News, have played a much bigger role. These outlets generally steer away from clearly falsifiable assertions — they have to worry about lawsuits. But they nonetheless want to do all they can to undermine the Biden administration, so they have done their best to raise doubts about the vaccines’ safety and effectiveness.

The effect has been to encourage many Republicans to think of getting vaccinated as an imposition, a cost they’re being asked to bear rather than a benefit they’re being offered — and, of course, something they’re primed to oppose precisely because it’s something Democrats want to see happen. Medical experts may say that going unvaccinated greatly increases your risk of getting seriously ill or dying, but hey, what do they know?

As I said, there probably aren’t very many Americans, even among self-identified Republicans, who really believe the vaccine horror stories — or are willing to make large, visible personal sacrifices in the name of “freedom.” So as soon as the cost of going unvaccinated stops being about statistics and becomes concrete — refuse the shot, lose your job — most vaccine resistance evaporates.

All of this has a clear policy implication for the Biden administration and for other leaders like governors and mayors — namely, full speed ahead. Vaccine mandates won’t cause mass resignations; they will cause a sharp rise in vaccination rates, which is key both to finally getting Covid under control and to achieving sustained economic recovery.

And Democrats shouldn’t fear the political fallout. Almost nobody will vote Republican because they’re enraged by public health rules, since such people are most likely to vote Republican anyway. What really matters for Democrats’ political fortunes is that life in America be visibly getting much better by next fall — and getting shots in arms is the way to make that happen."

This article feels like many I've seen, like it is intended to persuade through use of half-truths and fallacies rather than report, or *present truth* to a public.  And ironically, the article pushes against ""misinformation"", while using mis-informative tactics.

  
 ***""dozens of Facebook groups centered around ivermectin remain active despite insufficient evidence that the medicine works in treating people for COVID-19.""***

But we all understand that absence of evidence, is not evidence, right?  And large scale long term double blind studies may be the gold standard of evidence, but there are many kinds of evidence relied upon by healthcare providers to varying degrees.  And anyone objectively reviewing the evidence, actually digging in, looking at outcomes in the twenty countries have tried the drug as official policy, looking at the metadata studies, and particularly recent outcomes in the Indian province Uttar Pradesh, would have to admit there is evidence supporting use of the drug.  We can disagree as to whether the evidence is ""sufficient"".  It seems this article means that if people discuss the evidence in anything other than a critical light, that will be cast as misinformation.   

***“The promise that there are miracle solutions to an illness is really persuasive”***

Does the quoted doctor have to resort to a straw man to make her point?  How about this ""The suggestion that an existing anti-viral medication, that has very low incidence of serious side effects, reduces chances of getting, or getting sick from, COVID, is really persuasive"".  That would be a true statement.  And, there are plenty of reputable experts out there supporting responsible use of the drug in addition to vaccination and other therapies.  Why are none of them cited for their view?  

***“And the idea that individuals can manage their own health, if they read a lot, gather information and make their own decisions is really powerful.”***

... is she disagreeing with this concept?  The medical ""informed consent"" model has been around a long time and is not controversial.  This literally should be the goal in healthcare.

***""But ivermectin-related calls to poison control centers this year have more than tripled compared to the same period last year, with 1,440 calls through Sept. 20, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers.""***

It is hard to imagine anything less surprising, given that much larger than typical numbers of people began taking the drug, and given that there are over 300 million of us in the US.  The material fact would have been to know how many of those calls led to serious medical issues.

***“You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y’all. Stop it,” the agency said on Twitter.*** 

This kind of rhetoric, falsely portraying the drug as not meant for humans, along with dismissively calling it a ""dewormer"", is just dishonest and makes the agency lose credibility.  The drug is frequently prescribed for human use.  In fact ... ""\[i\]n 2018, ivermectin was the 420th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one hundred thousand prescriptions. The drug is also being researched as a way to treat or prevent tropical diseases including yellow fever and malaria.""

101,101,1632860846,"Here's the full text of the op-ed:

---

Yesterday every single Republican senator voted to shut down the U.S. government and provoke a global financial crisis.

Of course, they claimed otherwise; Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, portrayed the vote against raising the debt limit as a test of Democrats’ ability to govern, and some of his colleagues claimed to be taking a stand for fiscal responsibility. But everyone involved understood that this was an act of political sabotage. And the terrible thing is that it might work.

The U.S. debt limit is a very peculiar institution, because when combined with the filibuster it gives a minority party the ability to undermine basic governance. You might think that once Congress has passed fiscal legislation — once it has passed bills that set spending levels and tax rates — that would be the end of the story. But if this duly enacted legislation leads to a budget deficit, which requires that the U.S. government issue debt, as few as 40 senators can then block the needed borrowing, creating a crisis.

And the crisis could be very severe. It’s not just that the federal government would run out of money, forcing curtailment of essential services. U.S. government debt plays an essential role in the global financial system because Treasury securities are used as collateral in financial transactions around the world. During the brief Covid-induced financial panic of March 2020 interest rates on short-term Treasuries actually went negative, as frightened investors piled into the safest assets they could think of.

Make U.S. debt unsafe — make the U.S. government an unreliable counterparty, because its ability to pay its bills is contingent on the whims of an irresponsible opposition party — and the disruption to world markets could be devastating.

So why would Republicans flirt with such an outcome? Because they’re completely ruthless — and they’ve learned the lesson of the New Jersey sharks.

Or, if you want to put it in slightly more pedestrian terms, the G.O.P. has now weaponized retrospective voting.

It has long been clear that voters are far less informed about parties’ policy actions than we’d like to imagine, even when those policies touch their lives directly. Earlier this year most Americans received stimulus checks thanks to the American Rescue Plan, which was enacted by Democrats on a straight party-line vote. Yet a poll of rural voters found that only half gave Democrats credit for those checks; a third credited Republicans, not one of whom supported the plan.

So what do voters respond to? In general, they tend to support the incumbent party when things are going well, oppose it if things are going badly — even if the positive or negative events have no conceivable relationship to that party’s actions.

The political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels like to use the example of the 1916 election, which was much closer than most people expected; in particular, Woodrow Wilson lost his home state of New Jersey. Why? Achen and Bartels make a compelling case that one major factor was the panic created by a wave of shark attacks along New Jersey’s beaches. Whatever you think of Wilson, he wasn’t responsible for those sharks. But voters blamed him anyway.

More prosaically, many presidential contests turn on how the economy was doing in the few quarters before the election, even though presidents usually have relatively little influence on short-term economic developments, certainly as compared with the Federal Reserve. When people voted against Jimmy Carter, they were really voting against Paul Volcker, the Fed chairman at the time, who pushed the economy into recession to curb inflation — but they didn’t know that.

Of course, retrospective voting isn’t new. What is new is the complete ruthlessness of the modern Republican Party, which is single-mindedly focused on regaining power, never mind the consequences for the rest of the country.

So ask yourself: If a party doesn’t care about the state of the nation when the other party is in power, and it knows that its opposition suffers when bad things happen, what is its optimal political strategy? The answer, obviously, is that it should do what it can to make bad things happen.

Sometimes the sabotage strategy is almost naked. Consider Ron DeSantis, governor of Florida. DeSantis has done everything he can to prevent an effective response to the latest pandemic wave — trying to block mask and vaccine requirements, even by private businesses. Yet this hasn’t stopped him from blaming President Biden for failing to end Covid.

And now comes the debt crisis. Nobody has ever accused McConnell of being stupid. He knows quite well just how disastrous failing to raise the debt limit could be. But the disaster would occur on Biden’s watch. And from his point of view, that’s all good."

&gt;**Scientists unanimously told The Intercept that the experiment, which involved infecting genetically engineered mice with “chimeric” hybrid viruses, could not have directly sparked the pandemic**. None of the viruses listed in the write-ups of the experiment are related to the virus that causes Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, closely enough to have evolved into it. Still, several scientists said the new information, which the NIH released after it was sued by The Intercept, points to biosafety concerns, highlighting a general lack of oversight for research on pathogens and raising questions about what other information has not been publicly disclosed.

we don't actually know china's role, as they've shot down any attempt at a legitimate investigation into covid-19 origins... As someone who isn't american, just because trump was likely criminally negligent, that doesn't absolve china's role...

i suspect the chinese government is aware of covid-19's origin. which is why they don't want investigations into it."
123,123,1632762103,Seems like way too many republicans are dying of covid for him to win.
124,124,1632742429,I don't know how dry it was. There was Covid spreading everywhere.
125,125,1632738813,"&gt;An interview with former President Donald Trump's FDA Commissioner revealed that the administration was dismissive of any efforts to fight COVID-19 because they assumed ""everyone"" was going to get it anyway, and they essentially wanted to get it over with. Speaking to CNN's Pamela Brown, Dr. Scott Gottlieb explained that he thinks the government should militarize viruses like this because it's a national security threat and existing structures aren't made to handle such a massive pathogen. ""I remember one White House official cavalierly saying to me, and this was around the time that then-President Trump was pushing for schools to reopen,"" Brown recalled."
126,126,1632684558,"So trying ""Should include vaccinations"".  At no cost to the nurses.  Believe me when I say they've already sworn to do their best and they go through so many other protocols This is a one.- off needle prick and done two minutes at best.  Just suiting up to just go into the Covid area takes far longer."
127,127,1632683457,"So now that you understand, you know why N95 masks only reduce the risk of infection, not eliminate it. And basic math should tell you how it happens, since COVID-19 wards are fairly full of infectious aerosols."
128,128,1632661776,"Religious views don't kill people in a short period of time like Covid does, bad analogy try again."
129,129,1632661537,So why do you assume N95 masks make covid spread impossible? Doctors and nurses wearing N95 masks do catch covid.
130,130,1632660597,"&gt; they are covered in PPE. So its not like they are going to be spreading Covid.

What's the 95 in N95 mean, Science Man?"
131,131,1632640740,Seriously. We were all there for this mess. Guy should be tried for intentional negligence for.every. single. American. covid. death.
132,132,1632638198,"He doesn't trust masks &amp; the vaccine, he actually said we should eat more fruit, a balanced diet and exercise more to overcome Covid.

A little demon sperm won't hurt...

You can't make this up.

The Florida Surgeon General, the state's head overseer of health education and legislation...

Just stay away from salad dressing, it includes the vaccine and microchips..."
133,133,1632630242,"&gt;Many of the efforts to oppose masks in schools to reduce spread of COVID-19 have been prompted by conservative citizens’ groups and backed by Republican state lawmakers. For instance, at the Kenosha School Board meeting Tuesday, a group called Moms for Liberty—a right-wing national organization with local chapters that opposes mask requirements and curriculum about systemic racism—pushed through a reduction in school board members’ salaries from $6,500 annually to $100 per meeting attended, recommended a property tax cut that would give schools about $7 million less funding, and instated a requirement for board members to attend meetings in person to be paid."

135,135,1632618746,"Look at some of traitor Trump's 2020 claims about the Covid-19 crisis:

**January 22:** “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. It’s going to be just fine.”

**February 2:** “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”

**February 24:** “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

**February 25:** “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

**February 25:** “I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”

**February 26:** “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

**February 26:** “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

**February 27:** “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

**February 28:** “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

**March 2:** “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

**March 2:** “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”

**March 4:** “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to **work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

**March 5:** “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

**March 5:** “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

**March 6:** “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

**March 6:** “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

**March 6:** “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

**March 6:** “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

**March 8:** “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.”

**March 9:** “This blindsided the world.”

137,137,1632606806,"So there *is* a shortage if skilled nurses, but you aren’t losing equally skilled nurses with each  anti vaxxer; some work ICU, some L&amp;D, some ED, some outpatient care, etc, and some are easier to replace than others. The problem is real but fixable, even given the timeline of “we need to hire more nurses TODAY”. It’s fixable because the nursing supply is artificially deflated by conflating the number of nurses being hired and trained by hospitals vs the number of certified RNs actually available. 

we do NOT have a *graduated nurses* shortage - we actually have an oversupply in many areas of new RNs who can’t get hired in nearby because hospitals don’t want to pay to train them (they are already certified and have provided care in clinical settings usually including hospitals, but inexperienced with working on their own without supervision). A lot of those new nurses are being diverted away from hospitals who need them because hospital admin doesn’t want to pay, and instead those new nurses work in non-critical/not-as-urgent care settings (at home care, hospice, school nurses, covid testing clinics, etc). They might burn out there from lack of pay and overworked but even the ones who get hired by a hospital are overworked due to hospital admin shortstaffing... because they refuse to hire the number of nurses actually needed due to training costs.... so the few nurses that get hired by hospitals burn out even with the high pay after a few years and THEN move to non critical care settings or out of nursing altogether, wasting all the money they used (and in some cases the state or hospital paid for) to train to be a nurse. Plenty of new RNs are forced to move far away to get a decent job, but that leads to unhappiness and burn out too - you lose all your social network and end up in bumfuck Nebraska running an underfunded clinic after being told that sunny, metropolitan areas of California are desperate for nurses and how lucrative the degree is."
138,138,1632603139,Still firing them will put the hospitals in a extremely risky position.  It is a complex situation and no easy answers.  Nobody deserves to be on a pedestal for doing their job and while doing it they are covered in PPE. So its not like they are going to be spreading Covid.
139,139,1632530727,"&gt;Still, for many critics, the conclusions reached by the firm Cyber Ninjas and presented at a hearing Friday, underscored the dangerous futility of the exercise, which has helped fuel skepticism about the validity of the 2020 election and spawned copycat audits nationwide. None of the reviews can change Biden’s victory, which was certified by officials in each of the swing states he won and by Congress on Jan. 6 — after Trump’s supporters, fueled by the same false charges that generated the audits, stormed the U.S. Capitol to try to prevent certification of his loss. It kicked off with Shiva Ayyadurai, a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic who claims to have invented email, presenting an analysis relying on “pattern recognition” that flagged purported anomalies in the way mail ballots were processed at the end of the election."

150,150,1632250508,I assumed it was because most of them died of COVID by now
151,151,1632244004,"&gt;(A similar dynamic is playing out in prisons, where the corrections union has sued to overturn a vaccine mandate in Pennsylvania, while their counterparts in Massachusetts have sworn to investigate ""all legal and legislative"" options to avoid consenting to a vaccine order. Add in many jail staffers’ reported resistance to even wearing masks, and you have a toxic breeding ground for COVID transmission complete with a captive audience.)

&gt;Almost 61 percent of New York City residents have gotten fully vaccinated, but just 48 percent of NYPD employees; almost 70 percent of Los Angeleans, but just 54 percent of LAPD employees are. Even in Rick DeSantis’ Florida, 70 percent of Miami denizens have received both shots compared to just half of police department employees. Vaccination rates aren’t available for most police departments, but those sample numbers explain why five cops died in South Florida in a seven-day period, while last week 22 officers in New Jersey succumbed to the virus.

snip

&gt;Nearly all of these lawsuits hinge on claims that these mandates violate police officers’ constitutional rights, which is genuinely rich coming from this lot. In New York City, where officials have mandated that officers who refuse to get vaccinated must be tested weekly—the literal least they could do in a job that requires regular engagement with the public—the police union is demanding that officers be tested while on duty or that they be paid time-and-a-half for after-hours testing, while the testing mandate in Los Angeles has been dubbed “highly intrusive” by those behind the lawsuit. (Roughly 3,000 LAPD staff are expected to claim religious exemption from vaccine mandates.)

&gt;It’s astounding to watch the same cops who justify atrocities up to murder with the refrain that people should’ve “just complied” pretend to be persecuted when told they’re not allowed to be superspreaders. It lays bare how little the police believe the law applies to them, even when it’s unquestionably the right thing to do.

&gt;And yet, cops are the people given license to enforce mask mandates in many places, even as they shirk the responsibility of wearing them. **Never mind the drain on taxpayer resources that result from irresponsible unvaxxed cops not getting shots—seriously, an entire department in Illinois was out with COVID in August—or from demanding they be paid for getting a daily test they wouldn’t need if inoculated, the threat to public health and safety created by police vaccine refusal should worry us all.**"

&gt;DeSantis’s administration is purposefully not putting as much emphasis on them as public health experts and the Biden administration would like, in part because doing so, they say, can have unintended consequences.

&gt;“Vaccine hesitancy is complicated, and overreaching government mandates can make people even more hesitant to get the vaccine,” said Christina Pushaw, a spokeswoman for DeSantis. “While vaccination is the responsible choice for most people, focusing on vaccination to the exclusion of anything else is shortsighted.”

Trump killed the Pandemic Response Team in 2018 to save money due to his huge budget deficit leaving the country unprepared for COVID-19.

Trump talked trash about the long predicted pandemic, lying about it and blaming everyone from Democrats to the Chinese while 1/2 million Americans died from Trump's incompetence.

Then Trump tried a coup after he lost the 2020 election.

Whether they did it out of political spite, naivete or as part of calculated effort to unduly influence the outcome of elections by settling them in red states matters not at this point. They've got to swallow their pride and admit their mistake and enforce existing law with regard to illegal immigration before more COVID infected foreigners, more drug dealers, more sex traffickers, more criminals and possible terrorists come into our great nation."

“I am one of those white, common sense conservatives,” Palin said. “I believe in science and I have not taken the shot.”

“One, because the waitress never came back to ask me if I’m ready for that shot,” she continued. “But two, because I do believe in science and the Fauci-ism of the day back then was, if you’ve had COVID — I’ve had COVID — well then, Mother Nature was creating an immunity.”

&gt;Much of the conflict surrounds the mask rule. Though not an outright ban, the proviso prevents school districts from using state money to enforce a rule requiring masks. Nearly every person at a school has their salaries paid with some state money.

&gt;Lawmakers stuck the proposal in the state budget two days after McMaster ended the state of emergency. The governor has at times suggested masks do little to protect from the virus or they cause developmental delays in younger children.

&gt;“Last week an anti-masker said to me, ‘It’s sad that my children are being asked to protect yours. It’s not their job. That’s your job,’” she told board members. “Since when is it sad to teach our children empathy and compassion and selflessness by protecting the vulnerable?”"
165,165,1631904281,I don’t think the people looking to rollback mail in voting changes made for COVID are underestimating Democrats.  Rolling back those changes reflects an acknowledgment that Democrats perform better when there are more ballots mailed.  Democrats know this and care that Republicans are making changes that improve Republicans chances at the polls.

Your comment is ambiguous."
168,168,1631888996,I hear this among people including family who had Covid. What they don't know is their level of protection. It's best to get vaccinated to be sure but they apparently know better than doctors and scientists.
169,169,1631882195,Nah.  They are pushing Republican controlled states to rollback mail in voting changes passed due to COVID.  Mailing out ballots advantages Democrats who have a much better ground game.  Greatly reduced mail in ballots poses risks for Democrats in midterms.

Oh, you mean the psycho who went to ***three separate spas, killing six asian and two non-asian women,*** at a time when anti-asian hate crimes were peaking due to Covid-related events? That shooting? Pretty sure there's a reason there were questions regarding it being a hate crime.

Target one specific person and your motivations could be anything, mask or not. Go on an eight person murder spree where three quarters of those you kill are asian across three locations in the middle of a time of anti-asian hate and people will very reasonably ask questions and, in the immediate aftermath, are likely to make claims of hate crimes due to the rather stunning profile of the case.

Also, claiming the egging was racially motivated ignores that he was ***utterly hated by everyone in the area he was visiting because he's an evil dumbass who thinks slave owners should get reparations***. They've got plenty of reasons to drive him out of the area in a minimally-violent way."

At this point in time , anybody denying the severity of the virus, the protection provided by the vaccine versus the incredibly minor risk of negative side effects, is absolutely unworthy of sympathy from the general public in any given situation they may happen to find themselves in because they did not get a scientifically proven safe vaccine to combat a scientifically proven deadly virus. We have tried and tried to get through to you people. Nicely, rudely, with legitimate scientific facts in favor of the vaccine, etc. and people like you still deny the severely of Covid-19, and the protection the vaccine offers. 

Mandates, and situations like this in the article, wouldn’t have been needed had people like you done the morally, and scientifically correct thing and just gotten the vaccine in a timely manner while adhering to other safety protocols. You people are metaphorical children, mandates are the adults coming in and making things right among the children.

179,179,1631754268,"&gt; Republican legislators in more than half of U.S. states, spurred on by voters angry about lockdowns and mask mandates, are taking away the powers state and local officials use to protect the public against infectious diseases.

&gt; A KHN review of hundreds of pieces of legislation found that, in all 50 states, legislators have proposed bills to curb such public health powers since the covid-19 pandemic began. While some governors vetoed bills that passed, at least 26 states pushed through laws that permanently weaken government authority to protect public health. In three additional states, an executive order, ballot initiative or state Supreme Court ruling limited long-held public health powers. More bills are pending in a handful of states whose legislatures are still in session.

&gt; In Arkansas, legislators banned mask mandates except in private businesses or state-run health care settings, calling them “a burden on the public peace, health, and safety of the citizens of this state.” In Idaho, county commissioners, who typically have no public health expertise, can veto countywide public health orders. And in Kansas and Tennessee, school boards, rather than health officials, have the power to close schools.

&gt; At least 17 states passed laws banning covid vaccine mandates or passports, or made it easier to get around vaccine requirements."
180,180,1631750957,"Firstly, let’s start w this.   

Here’s a fact: the research that made our vaccines even possible was from a decade of vaccine-driven scientists who picked up discarded vaccine research when it quit being sexy to the big pharma companies after SARS and MERS and so forth died down.  https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/how-decade-coronavirus-research-paved-way-covid-19-vaccines so the vaccines didn’t get pulled out of a magic hat by any means.  

It is not enough to say “they” have been recalled.  There are what, a dozen, or more different formulations, using different approaches.  There’s the mRNA type, dead virus bits type, etc etc.  Some have had some issues, it’s true, but a Ford and a Kia won’t be subject to the same recall and neither are these.  There have also been contaminant issues in some plants across the planet as the pharmaceutical companies tried to scale up.  Frankly, I’m surprised it has gone as smooth as it has.  The scale up was incredible.

So, once again, “the producers” is insufficient because you cannot just make Pfizer and J&amp;J etc into the same people. 

Each formulation must be examined on its own merits and the trial/phase information for all the American use items is widely available.  Some approaches lean towards adverse events in one direction, and others another.  Some of the non mRNA (old fashioned type vaccines, certain things are expected in a tiny percentage because of their genetic profiles, comorbidities, etc).  Which then played out in real life with clotting issues w one, heart inflammation w another etc.  Personally, I read up on them all, right from the source, the compiled statistical data, and decided that I was good with me and mine getting either the Moderna or the Pfizer vax, and I have been satisfied that with all new data, after billions of doses given, I would still choose those two.   

Regardless, with the sheer number of doses given, at this point, do we have statistically more comprehensive, more actively scrutinized data for anything else, any other drug?  I doubt it.  A sample size this big doesn’t have ridiculous margins of error like the polls at election time.  This is luxury.

But part of drug trial process is that the system is literally set up so that scrutinizing the data endlessly for the slightest hint of untenable cause and effect goes on forever.  This is true for every FDA-approved med/vax.  It is always “on trial”, even after approval.

That’s how we just found out Tylenol is suspicious for autism spectrum and ADHD issues https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-021-00754-4. Good old Tylenol!  And you bet there are scientists madly working to definitively rule that in or out and then the world’s medication usage instructions will adapt.  

If you have a specific health profile talk w your doctor about which is better/worse and use the data.   I mean covid doesn’t kill as many infected as Ebola but it infects/spreads like wildfire and so has killed so many more than the worst Ebola outbreak.  

I’m not going to poo poo you for your natural/spiritual views etc but I’ll say this.  I grew up in the cult compound my parents adhere to and their go-natural views (and starving me for punishment and a few other things) almost killed me several times.   Snake bites are natural.   Your body overwhelming your body with an over the top immune system response as it mistakenly kills your lung cells while trying to kill virus is natural, too.  

We’re in a shitty spot."

There is no political solution to Covid sadly, and it simply would not go away on its own and the more desperate Trump got, more people jumped on the bandwagon in support of him.  I truly don't see them as ""Wanting mass death"" even though it was the normal outcome of their ignoring it/denying it."

Pfizer (Biontech) is fully FDA approved and [widely available](https://www.goodrx.com/covid-19/pfizer#find-a-pfizer-vaccine).

Besides, [over 3.5 billion vaccine doses](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) of all types have been administered.  Incidents of serious adverse effects are extremely rare -- orders of magnitude rarer than fatal cases of Covid.


What we're seeing now is that many people who claimed to be waiting for FDA approval *still* aren't getting vaccinated, now with some other excuse.  Many of them are taking unproven medications like Ivermectin that aren't FDA approved for covid treatment.

 People who don't want to get vaccinated are usually stubbornly clinging to some misguided ideology.  [Many of them are dying for it.](/r/HermanCainAward)"
217,217,1631536241,"""Polio is different, because we know that polio has devastating effects.""

Is he insinuating that COVID doesn't? 

At the height of the polio epidemic in 1952, there were around 58,000 infections. Of those, 3,000 died. Compare that to COVID, where there have been 41 **million** cases and 650,000 deaths. Even if 90% of those cases are misattributed to COVID, as some claim, that's still almost 100 times more cases than polio, 200 times more deaths.

This is what everyone knows and sees. Obama rightly pushed renewable energy -- we have to if we want to do something about global warming. But how did Obama do it?

In part by wasting tax money and throwing it to risky private ventures in solar tech. Quite similar to Trump throwing huge sums at Big Pharma to develop our much-needed COVID vaccines.

That's American and capitalist politics. That's why the Chinese -- half capitalist ""communists"" -- are going hog wild cracking down on corruption.

Here in the US we have no similar anti-corruption drive. It's so bad that *honest* politicians say things like:

&gt; Americans are now experiencing ""a complete subversion of our political system as a payoff to major contributors."" The U.S. is an ""oligarchy with unlimited political bribery."" -- Jimmy Carter, the oldest living US president ([source](https://theintercept.com/2015/07/30/jimmy-carter-u-s-oligarchy-unlimited-political-bribery/)).

But we see no reforms being done. :-(

&gt; The divisive politics are useful to distract from reality.

That's the key. It's the ""bread and circuses"" that the Roman Empire used thousands of years ago. Here we issue gov't checks, offer up sound-bite ""politics"" to cheer for the Red team or the Blue team, and watch NFL football when we get sick of politics.

Somehow I don't think that's going to fix things!

&gt; People frothing with hate for each other are easy to rule.

Exactly! The divide and conquer theory of rule. Keep people distracted.

As one liberal teacher commented:

&gt; ""I realized these kids -- all of us -- are being indoctrinated, not just by the schools but also by the press and entertainment. Rather than thinking critically, we’re encouraged to react emotionally. One of the media’s purposes is to keep our emotions stirred up so we don’t think too much."" -- High school social studies teacher Judy Davis."

The annual Sturgis motorcycle rally in South Dakota is America’s largest bike rally, a 10-day blowout, with attendance this year exceeding 250,000. It was also a serious pandemic stress test. By bringing together hundreds of thousands of people, Sturgis helps answer a simple yet critically important question: Are we at a point in the pandemic where we can safely stage big-crowd events?

That’s what makes Sturgis an important test. If it had gone off without big spikes in covid cases, it would have provided strong evidence that this level of population immunity — around 75 percent — would allow us to get back to the way we did things in 2019. But unfortunately, that’s not what happened. In the weeks since the rally began in early August, infection numbers have shot up more than 600 percent in South Dakota. We can expect to see big increases in other states, too, since bikers returned home from the event. Last year, after Sturgis, we saw massive outbreaks across the Dakotas, Wyoming, Indiana, even Nevada. Much of the region was aflame because of Sturgis, probably causing thousands of deaths.
In August, tens of thousands of bikers attended the 10-day annual Sturgis motorcycle rally in South Dakota's Black Hills despite a surge of coronavirus cases. (Reuters)

Does the large Sturgis outbreak this year mean we can’t stage large gatherings? The answer affects things far beyond bike rallies: music festivals, state fairs, large concerts and so much more. The good news is that the outbreak doesn’t have to mean we rule all of that out. We can begin to get things back to a new normal. And here we can look to other examples where high levels of vaccinations or other tools helped prevent a lot of illness and death.

The first example is what happened in Provincetown, Mass., over the July 4 weekend. Provincetown unfortunately also led to a spike in cases — but the infection numbers peaked quickly, dwindled and were gone three weeks later. There were very few hospitalizations and no deaths. Why? Because most of the people in Provincetown were vaccinated. That may be an indicator that population immunity from vaccinations is better and more protective than immunity from infections.

Consider also this summer’s Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago. All those attending were required to provide proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test. Anyone unvaccinated was required to wear masks throughout, even though the festival was outdoors. And those attending were asked to accept a “Lollapalooza Fan Health Pledge” promising they had not tested positive or been exposed to covid within two weeks or experienced any covid symptoms within 48 hours. The result? Of the hundreds of thousands of fans who attended the festival, only a few hundred have subsequently tested positive — and it is unclear whether any of them were infected at Lollapalooza.

Eighteen months into the pandemic, we’ve learned that outdoor gatherings are reasonably safe — it’s the indoor activities that invariably follow that are deadly. At Sturgis, it is unlikely that the outdoor bike rallies were a problem. Most of the spread likely happened in the evenings, when people crowded into bars and restaurants, most unvaccinated, all unmasked. Large gatherings that work on keeping indoor spaces safe through vaccinations, masking, ventilation and other techniques can keep the entire gathering safer.

Over the past year, every time we have tried to defy the virus by scorning precautions, the virus has won, and people have suffered and died: significant outbreaks, a lot of hospitalizations, too many deaths. Large gatherings like rallies, festivals and fairs are the biggest test of what our society can do in a pandemic.

The simple interpretation of the large outbreak after Sturgis is that big gatherings are just not possible during a pandemic. But that is the wrong lesson. It’s important for Americans to find ways to come together. So we should ask how we can make gatherings safer.

Here, the pandemic playbook is straightforward: Ensure you have a highly vaccinated population. Verify people’s vaccination status. Require rapid and frequent testing, especially for the unvaccinated. Improve indoor air quality, and use masking intermittently when needed.

None of these are difficult to achieve. And none of them should be particularly inconvenient. If we do all that, we can safely get back to the things we love and the events that bring us together, like music festivals, concerts and motorcycle rallies."

In the heady days of spring, when the United States was vaccinating 3 million people a day, President Biden predicted a “summer of joy.” But then the vaccination campaign stalled, and the Delta variant fueled a new wave of infections, hospitalizations and deaths.

This didn’t have to happen. True, Delta’s contagiousness has led to rising caseloads almost everywhere. But America has pulled away from other advanced countries in hospitalizations and deaths:

There’s no mystery about why this has happened: It’s political. True, there are many Americans refusing to take the vaccines for nonpolitical reasons. There’s general distrust of authority figures, there’s distorted word of mouth — a friend of a friend heard about someone who had a bad reaction. (Even in my sheltered social set, I know people like that.) But the systematic refusal to get vaccinated, refusal to wear masks, etc., is very clearly tied to the unique way that common-sense public health measures have been caught up in the culture war.

According to a recent NBC poll, 91 percent of Biden voters have been vaccinated but only 50 percent of Trump voters. Or look at death tolls: Blue states look more like Canada or Germany than like Florida or Texas:

And aside from, you know, killing people, the politically driven Covid resurgence is taking an economic toll. The August jobs report wasn’t terrible — the recovery hasn’t stalled — but it was disappointing. And while there was, as always, some dispute about exactly what the numbers are telling us, with some labor economists pushing back against calling it purely a Delta story, the best bet is that the resurgent virus was the biggest factor in the disappointment, as people cut back on going out to eat, traveling and so on.

By the way, this economic hit took place despite the absence of anything like the lockdowns we experienced earlier in the pandemic. There have been very few new restrictions on economic activity imposed by state and local governments; some places have reimposed indoor mask requirements, but shopping and even flying while masked is entirely doable. No, what’s happening is individual caution reasserting itself.

And the economic hit isn’t looking nearly as bad as what we experienced in earlier waves of the pandemic. That’s the good news. The bad news is that in those previous waves, America did a surprisingly good job of stepping up to help those suffering from the economic fallout. This time we aren’t.

Given America’s historical track record of failing to help those in need, our initial response to the pandemic was almost miraculously good: generous unemployment benefits, checks sent to most households, expansions of other benefits. Why was this politically possible? Partly, I think, because at first even many conservatives saw pandemic unemployment as an act of God, not a personal failing on the part of the unemployed. Partly, also, progressives had ideas about what to do, while the Trump administration and its allies were clueless. So there was an element of the “Yes, Prime Minister” effect: We must do something. This is something. Therefore, we must do it.

In any case, the result was remarkable: Despite huge job losses, poverty actually fell.

But the most important of the pandemic relief programs, enhanced unemployment benefits, has now expired, with no prospect of renewal, given brutal political divides and the return of Republicans to their traditional view that helping the unemployed makes them lazy. If we’d had the summer of joy we were promised, this wouldn’t be so bad. But the stalled vaccination campaign — again, largely although not entirely a political phenomenon — has fed a viral resurgence that’s holding back the economy, which means that millions of workers are still stranded. And this time they aren’t getting the relief they need.

Now, there was a hiatus in enhanced unemployment benefits last fall, and for the most part, families made it through: Many had accumulated savings in 2020, and this tided them over until benefits were restored that December. And maybe, just maybe, this won’t work out too badly. There are hints in the data that the Delta wave is subsiding, and vigorous job growth may resume in time to rescue the unemployed.

But maybe not. Politics has already given us a completely unnecessary tragedy: thousands of preventable deaths despite the ready availability of lifesaving vaccines. And we may be about to suffer a gratuitous economic tragedy on top of that."
269,269,1631035317,"The known natural reservoir of COVID most similar to what caused the global pandemic is in intermediate horseshoe bats in Yunnan.  That’s where the people at the Wuhan institute of virology got the virus from which they created novel chimeric SARS-related coronaviruses.  As I’ve said, the most plausible explanation for the outbreak that started in Wuhan is a release of the virus from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  The silencing of people and destruction of data only highlights this reality.

I’m certainly open to the possibility that it instead evolved naturally and just happened to cause a pandemic adjacent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  But I have not heard any serious explanation for how this happened.  Have you?"
270,270,1630992796,"Link? 

That would imply that the people of India, where the delta variant was first detected, had access to the vaccine. Viral loads are equal in vaccinated vs unvaccinated. Only difference is it’s shorter lived in vaccinated and they show less symptoms. Yes this is still being studied. This implies the ability for covid to spread even more as these people don’t know they should be isolating. This hurts those who are immunocompromised even more."

&gt; ""I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure...I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body, as well as the infirm.""

&gt; Marraccini is also not the first doctor to refuse to treat unvaccinated patients."
273,273,1630964849,"I am a doctor. Not *just* a doctor but a MD/PhD Research Geneticist. I actually have my work in the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. And let me tell you: you are wrong. Very very wrong.

And believe me, this isn't just some vast conspiracy. Doctors aren't telling you not to take horse dewormer with some ulterior political motive.

Where to even start with this...?

Okay first of all just because you read ""Ivermectin"" on a product doesn't mean it's the same thing. What people aren't taking into account (among many things) are the inactive ingredients. At the end of the day horses and humans are biologically very different and as a result the drugs are formulated differently. The way they interact with the body is different because, again, made for horses.

In addition to it not even working properly due to it being inherently the wrong formulation for human biology: horse dewormer is made for horses. They're very large mammals. The dosage (and importantly *concentration*) for a horse is significantly larger than the dose for a human. Worse, high doses of Ivermectin is toxic for humans. You can overdose, and yes, it can put you in a coma or even kill you. And even if it doesn't there would likely be some very nasty side effects like dizziness, loss of balance, seizures, vomiting, diarrhea, and hives. On top of what someone is already going through... you really don't want to add any of that. And yes, we've already seen reports of people requiring urgent medical assistance, even hospitalization after trying to self medicate with it.

Not only that but while it's true that Ivermectin is sometimes prescribed to treat head lice, rosacea, and such, for humans Ivermectin is typically topical (i.e. applied externally).

Let's set all of that aside for a moment. As I noted I am a researcher. So let's talk about why this nonsense even came about. It started with [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011) which has (to start with) been widely misinterpreted by laymen. While yes that ""study"" ""showed"" that Ivermectin slowed replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the lab it used concentrations that are not readily achieved in the human body - and remember what I said about high concentrations being toxic for humans?

Now why did I put ""study"" and ""showed"" in quotes? The paper relied on data from Surgisphere that was automatically collected in a way that has been shown to be highly irregular and unreliable. The study claiming to have found beneficial effects in patients was withdrawn following allegations of data manipulation. Surgisphere, I'll note, was at the center of that major scandal around hydroxychloroquine studies as well - and we all know how hydroxychloroquine went. Surgisphere has since deleted its website and social media accounts. *Wonder why...*

Everything since claiming treatment benefits from Ivermectin against COVID-19 have been plagued with errors and methodological flaws.

Finally, [clinical trials](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&amp;term=ivermectin&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=&amp;Search=Search) (note: by actual doctors and scientists, with the appropriate formulation for humans in safe doses &amp; concentrations) have thus far shown ivermectin ineffective for the prevention or the treatment of COVID-19.

And if you do want to get into laughable political territory, Senator Rand Paul (for instance) suggested hatred for Trump was what's hindering Ivermectin research. No... no, that would be Senator Rand Paul (lol). He voted against the bill that included funding for the NIH ACTIV-6 trial which is studying Ivermectin.

Now let me be real with you for a moment... You don't need to go out and take animal products suggested by kooks, drink bleach, or whatever other wackiness the next crackpot comes up with. We already have preventative treatments that are highly efficacious. **Get the vaccine.**

They're showing really promising efficacy even against the delta variants. Something like 99.3% of the COVID-19 deaths in the US now are from the unvaccinated. The one concern we're dealing with atm is efficacy we've recently been seeing is dropping. Pfizer for instance's efficacy has held steady against severe cases after 6 months. But protection against developing any symptoms decreases over time. At 6 months it drops to about 91% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19. It's dropping however at around 6% every 2 months. Against severe cases efficacy stayed at 97% for an entire 6 month period. You can read the whole thing [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.28.21261159v1.full.pdf).

If you have some kind of paranoia against mRNA vaccines like the Pfizer-BioNTech &amp; Moderna ones (I really don't have it in me anymore to try to explain why that's illogical to people that don't trust or believe logic) then get the Johnson &amp; Johnson one instead. It uses the old traditional methods of a harmless deactivated virus that has been used for a very very long time. And it's highly efficacious at preventing severe cases that'd require hospitalization.

And that's the bottom line: Just get the damn vaccine. It doesn't matter what one. Just get one (that's approved)."

292,292,1630685142,"‘When an Arizona school employee called a parent on Thursday to share that his son had come in close contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus, the dad was told his son must stay at home for at least a week.

Instead, later that morning, the man walked into Mesquite Elementary School with his son and two other men carrying zip ties before confronting the principal over the school’s quarantine policy, Vail Unified School District Superintendent John Carruth told The Washington Post.

In a meeting with the principal, Carruth said, the men threatened to call local authorities and conduct a “citizen’s arrest” if the student was not allowed to rejoin school activities immediately. That is when the principal, who explained that the school was following guidance issued by the local health department, ordered the trio to leave, Carruth said.

“Today was a tough day,” he told The Post. “One of the most powerful tools as adults is the behavior that we model to young people — and the behavior that was modeled today makes me really sad.”

A spokesperson with the Tucson Police Department confirmed that officers responded to the incident. Police did not identify the three men and did not say whether any charges had been brought against the trio.

Diane Vargo, the principal of the elementary school, which has more than 600 students, did not immediately respond to a message from The Post late Thursday.

One of the men who accompanied the dad to the school recorded part of the incident and posted the video to Instagram. When contacted for comment early Friday, he said he was not immediately available for an interview and referred The Post to another social media video where he and the student’s father discussed the incident.

The event at the southern Arizona school marks yet another incident of parents protesting covid-19 mandates as schools reopen and cases tied to the highly transmissible delta variant surge. Some have launched verbal assaults at teachers, while others have turned physical against both teachers and students.

Last month, one parent in Texas ripped a teacher’s mask off her face. Other parents in that same district yelled at a teacher wearing a mask because they claimed it made it hard to understand what she was saying. That same month, a father in Florida was charged with assaulting a student who confronted him about not wearing a mask. 

Earlier on Thursday in Arizona, Mesquite Elementary School had contacted the father to let him know that his son and at least six other schoolmates had been exposed to someone infected with the virus, Carruth told The Post.

The district’s policy is based on guidance issued by the Pima County Health Department that says all children must stay at home for at least seven days after potential exposure at school, the superintendent said. Students are allowed to return to school grounds if a coronavirus test taken five or more days into quarantine comes back negative and they have no symptoms for seven days. According to the district’s dashboard, the school has one active positive covid case.
Moments after receiving the news, the dad took to his social media to protest the school’s quarantine policy, Carruth said. One of the two men who later accompanied the dad to the school posted on Instagram about the situation.

“Apparently Mesquite Elementary thinks they can break the law and act like the covid Gestapo,” the man wrote, referencing Nazi Germany’s secret police. “We will be headed over there shortly to disagree. Come join us because we won’t have this in OUR community!”

Later that morning, the father and his son arrived at the school. The other two men met them in the school’s parking lot, Carruth said.

In a live video posted to Instagram, one of the two men who joined the dad told his followers that they were about to “confront this administration” for “breaking the law.”

“If necessary, we’ll do a citizen’s arrest,” the man said before showing off the “law enforcement zip ties” they brought.

Inside the principal’s office, the men confronted the administrator, arguing that quarantining “children that aren’t sick” breaks state law. No one in the video was wearing masks. The school district does not require them.

“If you insist on this, I’ll have you arrested,” one man said. “We’re ready to make a citizen’s arrest if necessary.”

“There will be no arrests here occurring on the Mesquite campus,” the principal said, adding that the school was following covid protocols.

“We’ll see about that,” the man responded.

“We don’t answer to you,” the student’s dad added. “ … My son will not be quarantined. My son will go back.”

“He needs to be quarantined,” the principal said, before asking the men to leave her office. When the men refused, the principal walked out and called the police, Carruth said.

No arrests were made on school grounds because the men left before police arrived, the superintendent said.

“Showing up to a school with zip ties is not a way to solve a problem,” Carruth said. “ … We welcome people with varying backgrounds and opinions, but we’ve got to come together. This is not okay.”"

Today’s column was inspired by the latest twist in our still shambolic response to Covid — the continuing refusal of many Americans to get vaccinated and the insistence of some of them on swallowing horse paste instead. I tried to link this horrifying, if comic, development to the long relationship between right-wing extremism and patent medicine. But I didn’t have space to put this in the broader context of how money influences politics and policy.

The simple fact is that none of us are saints. Even those who claim to be working for the common good can be and often are influenced by the prospect of personal reward. As conservative economists like to say, incentives matter.

Indeed, it’s usually conservative economists who make this point most strongly. Half a century ago George Stigler of the University of Chicago published a hugely influential paper titled “The theory of economic regulation,” which argued that government regulators — like the boards setting rules for electricity generation and pricing — weren’t like the wise, selfless guardians of Plato’s “Republic”; they were human and hence subject to influence, which in practice meant that regulators were often captured by the very industries they were supposed to regulate.

It was a good point, if perhaps too extreme — regulators may not be saints, but they aren’t always purely creatures of self-interest either. But it was too narrowly applied. Stigler’s followers have used his logic to make the case against regulation, arguing that regulators will be corrupted by special interests. But why restrict that insight to government officials? In particular, why not apply it to their own political movement?

After all, surely the same logic that applies to regulators also applies to politicians and pundits, including those on the right who denounce regulation. And for that matter, it applies to intellectuals too, especially in those situations where the possible rewards for expressing the “right” opinions go beyond prestige and promotion into the realm of cold, hard cash.

And as far back as I can remember, the world of conservative opinion and thought has, in fact, consisted largely of bought men and women. (I’ll talk about liberals in a minute.)

I don’t think it was always thus. I’m not a huge fan of Milton Friedman’s legacy, but I do believe that he — and for that matter, Stigler — said what they did out of genuine, unforced conviction. Things have, however, changed since their heyday. In fact, they’ve changed twice.

First came the rise of “movement conservatism” — a highly organized set of interlocking institutions, all backed by billionaires and big corporations, of which the Republican Party was only one piece. There were also media organizations, especially Fox, think tanks like the Heritage Foundation and more. By the aughts (we never did come up with a better name for this century’s first decade), these institutions had created a safe space, a guarantee of a stable and fairly lucrative career, for people willing to say the right things — tax cuts good, regulation bad — and not rock the boat.

I never thought I’d be nostalgic for the era when big money ruled the right. But traditional corporate influence looks benign compared with where we are now. At this point, to be a conservative in good standing you have to pledge allegiance to blatant lies — Democrats are Marxists, the election was stolen, basic public health measures are sinister assaults on freedom.

Why are so many people who have to know better willing to go along with these lies? Again, self-interest — partly ambition, and yes, partly financial reward. Obviously the snake-oil industry doesn’t have anything like the resources of more respectable Republican-leaning industries like fossil fuels or tobacco. But it offers more opportunities for personal enrichment: Ben Shapiro is presumably well paid for hawking “superfoods” in a way he couldn’t be for, say, promoting oil wells.

OK, what about liberals? They’re people too, with all the usual human flaws; there are plenty of prominent liberals who I know personally to be driven by ego and to some extent by monetary considerations, people like … actually, not going there. But they live in a different environment from conservatives.

The old Will Rogers line — “I am not a member of any organized political party — I am a Democrat” — still applies. Political science research confirms that the Republican Party, and conservatism in general, is an ideological monolith, albeit one largely under new management. Democrats and the center-left in general, by contrast, are a loose coalition, and to prosper in that coalition you have to satisfy multiple constituencies. This makes it harder to sell your soul, because it’s not clear who you’re supposed to sell it to.

In the subculture I know best, politically active economists, those on the left, no matter how passionate they are about their politics — and no matter how self-centered — feel the need to retain academic credibility and, for those who do consulting, credibility with serious business interests. (See, I told you nobody is a saint.) Many of my economist friends look very favorably on President Biden’s policies, but they wouldn’t risk their reputations by claiming that Biden has Nobel-quality economic insight — or selling nutritional supplements.

So the blend of craziness and corruption taking place on the American right is special, without anything comparable on the left. Don’t both-sides this."

You don’t hear much these days about “economic anxiety.” Most observers acknowledge that the rise of the Trumpist right was driven by racial and social antagonism, not economic populism.

Yet there is an economic element to political extremism, just not what you’d think. Right-wing extremists, and to some extent even more mainstream conservative media, rely on financial support from companies selling nutritional supplements and miracle cures — and that financial support is arguably a significant factor pushing the right to become more extreme. Indeed, right-wing extremism isn’t just an ideological movement that happens to get a lot of money from sellers of snake oil; some of its extremism can probably be seen not as a reflection of deep conviction, but as a way of promoting snake oil.

Consider where we are right now in the fight against Covid-19. A few months ago it seemed likely that the development of effective vaccines would soon bring the pandemic to an end. Instead, it goes on, with hospitalizations closing in on their peak from last winter. This is partly due to the emergence of the highly contagious Delta variant, but it also crucially reflects the refusal of many Americans to take the vaccines.

And much of this refusal is political. True, many people who are refusing to get vaccinated aren’t Trumpists, but there’s a strong negative correlation between Donald Trump’s share of a county’s vote and vaccinations. As of July, 86 percent of self-identified Democrats said they had had a vaccine shot, but only 54 percent of Republicans did.

But vaccine refusers aren’t just rejecting lifesaving vaccines, they’re also turning to life-threatening alternatives. We’re seeing a surge in sales of — and poisoning by — ivermectin, which is usually used to deworm livestock but has recently been touted on social media and Fox News as a Covid cure.

OK, I didn’t see that coming. But I should have. As the historian Rick Perlstein has pointed out, there’s a long association between peddlers of quack medicine and right-wing extremists. They cater to more or less the same audience.

That is, Americans willing to believe that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and that Italian satellites were used to switch votes to Joe Biden are also the kind of people willing to believe that medical elites are lying to them and that they can solve their health problems by ignoring professional advice and buying patent medicines instead.

Once you’re sensitized to the link between snake oil and right-wing politics, you realize that it’s pervasive.

This is clearly true in the right’s fever swamps. Alex Jones of Infowars has built a following by pushing conspiracy theories, but he makes money by selling nutritional supplements.

It’s also true, however, for more mainstream, establishment parts of the right. For example, Ben Shapiro, considered an intellectual on the right, hawks supplements.

Look at who advertises on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show. After Fox itself, the top advertisers are My Pillow, then three supplement companies.

Snake oil peddlers, clearly, find consumers of right-wing news and punditry a valuable market for their wares. So it shouldn’t be surprising to find many right-leaning Americans ready to see vaccination as a liberal plot and turn to dubious alternatives — although, again, I didn’t see livestock dewormer coming.

The interesting question, however, is to what extent the connection between right-wing politics and snake oil marketing has shaped the political landscape.

Put it this way: There are big financial rewards to extremism, because extreme politics sells patent medicine, and patent medicine is highly profitable. (In 2014 Alex Jones’s operations were bringing in more than $20 million a year in revenue, mainly from supplement sales.) Do these financial rewards induce pundits to be more extreme? It would be surprising if they didn’t — as conservative economists say, incentives matter.

The extremism of media figures radicalizes their audience, giving politicians an incentive to become more extreme.

So you can see how vaccination became such a flash point. Getting shots in arms is a priority for a Democratic president, which automatically generates intense hostility among people who want to see Joe Biden fail. And such people were already primed to reject medical expertise and believe in quack cures.

Surely everyone on the right noticed that even Donald Trump got booed recently when he told attendees at a rally that they should get vaccinated. He probably won’t say that again, and would-be future Trumps definitely won’t.

None of this would be happening if there weren’t a climate of anger and distrust for unscrupulous pundits and politicians to exploit. But the fact that extremism sells patent medicine creates a financial incentive to get more extreme.

You could say that if American democracy is in danger, that’s partly because sellers of snake oil — not bad policy ideas, but actual bad medicine — have been pulling off this one weird trick."
318,318,1630354489,"Here's the text of the op-ed:

---



During the first few months of 2021, President Biden seemed overly reluctant to go after GOP governors over their approach to the spread of covid-19 in their states. The thinking appeared in part to be that this would polarize masks and vaccines, making GOP voters more reluctant to utilize both, setting us back further.

But that reluctance became untenable, once GOP officials in positions of responsibility made the active decision to carry on Donald Trump’s project of using covid to stoke social and civil conflict. When GOP governors began blocking local officials from implementing mask mandates to protect their communities, that demanded a more aggressive federal response.

Now, in a move that throws down this gauntlet, Biden’s Education Department has sent letters to five GOP-run states, announcing civil rights investigations into measures that ban local mask mandates in various ways.

The letters announce such investigations in Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah. They do not target Florida and Texas and a few others, because those bans on universal masking are not currently being enforced due to legal actions or other circumstances.

As the letters note, the Education Department has the authority to determine whether state agencies that receive federal funding are complying with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which protects students with disabilities from discrimination.

An Education Department official explains to us that students with disabilities have a legal right to attend school with peers who do not have disabilities. But those with disabilities who are at higher risk from covid may face disproportionate danger when attending schools without mask mandates in person. So a state ban on mask requirements could end up denying equal access to in-person education.

And so, these civil rights investigations would seek in part to ascertain whether such children are indeed suffering in this manner as a result of the bans. The letters stress that no violation has yet been ascertained; these are merely inquiries.

As we’ve reported, if an official finding of a violation is made, the parties typical reach negotiated resolutions. But if not, federal funds can be used to prod the offender into dropping the discriminatory policy or violations can be passed to the Justice Department for more enforcement.

It’s hard to say how far all this will go. But if nothing else, this represents an escalation, in that federal power is now being marshaled to protect local communities against GOP governors that are blocking them from protecting themselves.

Harvard’s Laurence Tribe, who had previously advocated for moves like this, notes that what’s at issue is “the rights of America’s children to a safe classroom environment.”

“That legal strategy holds great promise of circumventing gubernatorial obstruction of vital local initiatives,” Tribe told us.

Tribe added that this is “essential in states whose governors are evidently more concerned with towing the ideological Trump line on vaccines and masks than they are with the health and survival of our kids.”

This sort of fact finding could matter in other ways. We need to know exactly what sort of impact these bans on mask mandates are having on local communities struggling to implement public health measures in the face not just of a covid surge but also of implacable ideological opposition from governors. Let’s hope these investigations shed more light.

The show of support from the federal government could also help mobilize the large majority who support local mask mandates and oppose efforts by governors to stand in their way, who are not nearly as loud or organized as the anti-mask derangement faction, but matter nonetheless.

As we keep arguing, Democrats need to be speaking directly to this neglected silent majority, because they need the support and because clarifying the stakes will be good for the country. If anything, we need more of this."

In my latest column, motivated by the California recall, I pointed out that the Golden State’s left turn on policy hasn’t produced the economic collapse that conservatives predicted. On the contrary, the state’s economy has boomed, even as it keeps getting trash-talked by the business press: Between the election of Jerry Brown and the Covid-19 pandemic, both output and employment grew about as fast in California as they did in Texas.

It has, however, been a peculiar kind of boom, one in which more Americans have moved out of California than have moved in.

Economists trying to understand the rise and fall of regions within a country often rely on some form of economic base analysis. The idea is that a region’s overall growth is determined by the performance of its export industries — that is, industries that sell mainly to customers outside the region, such as the technology firms of Silicon Valley and the Los Angeles entertainment complex (or, here in New York, the financial industry). Growth in these industries, however, generates a lot of growth in other sectors, from health care to retail trade, driven by the local spending of the base industries’ companies and employees.

But base analysis suggests that when a state has a booming export sector, as California does, it should be seeing growth in more or less everything. Instead, what we see in California is that while highly educated workers are moving in to serve the tech boom, less educated workers are moving out:

There’s no great mystery about why this is happening: It’s because of housing. California is very much a NIMBY state, maybe even a banana (build absolutely nothing anywhere near anyone) state. The failure to add housing, no matter how high the demand, has collided with the tech boom, causing soaring home prices, even adjusted for inflation:

And these soaring prices are driving less affluent families out of the state.

One way to think about this is to say that California as a whole is suffering from gentrification. That is, it’s like a newly fashionable neighborhood where affluent newcomers are moving in and driving working-class families out. In a way, California is Brooklyn Heights writ large.

Yet it didn’t have to be this way. I sometimes run into Californians asserting that there’s no room for more housing — they point out that San Francisco is on a peninsula, Los Angeles ringed by mountains. But there’s plenty of scope for building up.

If we look at population-weighted density — the population density of the neighborhood in which the average person lives — we find that greater New York is two and a half times as dense as the San Francisco and Los Angeles metro areas, with more than 30,000 people per square mile in New York and only around 12,000 in both California metros. This doesn’t mean that every New Yorker lives in a high-rise (the metro area includes plenty of leafy green suburbs), it only means that those who choose to live in multistory apartment buildings can do so. If California were willing to offer that choice, it wouldn’t have its housing crisis.

Personal aside: My New York apartment is in a neighborhood that, according to census data, has 60,000 residents per square mile, with many 10-plus-story buildings. It’s not a teeming sea of humanity; it’s surprisingly quiet and genteel!

The thing is, California’s housing problem, while especially extreme, isn’t unique.

Since the 1980s America has experienced growing regional divergence. We have become a knowledge economy driven by industries that rely on a highly educated work force, and firms in those industries, it turns out, want to be located in places where there are a lot of highly educated workers already — places like the Bay Area.

Unfortunately, most of these rising knowledge-industry hubs also severely limit housing construction; this is true even of greater New York, which is much denser than any other U.S. metropolitan area but could and should be even denser. As a result, housing prices in these metros have soared, and working-class families, instead of sharing in regional success, are being driven out.

The result is that there are now, in effect, two Americas: the America of high-tech, high-income enclaves that are unaffordable for the less affluent, and the rest of the country.

And this economic divergence goes along with political divergence, mainly because education has become a prime driver of political affiliation.

It may seem hard to believe now, but as recently as the early 2000s college graduates leaned Republican. Since then, however, highly educated voters — who have presumably been turned off by the G.O.P.’s embrace of culture wars and its growing anti-intellectualism — have become overwhelmingly Democratic, while non-college-educated whites have gone the other way.

As a result, the two Americas created by the collision of the knowledge economy and NIMBYism correspond fairly closely to the blue-red division: Democratic-voting districts have seen a big rise in incomes, while G.O.P. districts have been left behind:

Again, this didn’t have to happen, at least not to this extent. True, the growing concentration of knowledge industries in a few metropolitan areas reflects deep economic forces that are hard to fight. But not building enough housing to accommodate this concentration and share its benefits is a policy choice, one that is deepening our national divisions.

There are hints of movement toward less restrictive housing policy; California’s legislature has just passed a bill that would, in essence, force suburbs to accept some two-unit buildings alongside single-family homes. Even this modest measure would make it possible to add around 700,000 housing units — roughly the same number added in the whole state between 2010 and 2019.

We need much more of this. Restrictive housing policy doesn’t get nearly as much attention in national debates as it deserves. It is, in fact, a major force pulling our nation apart."

SpeakWithAnMD is closely tied with America’s Frontline Doctors, a group that went viral last year when its makeshift news conference in Washington got millions of views after one of the physicians, Dr. Stella Immanuel, falsely called hydroxychloroquine a “cure” for Covid-19.

337,337,1629961125,"&gt;An Alaska borough mayor, who says he is not a medical professional, has promoted a debunked treatment for COVID-19 that is intended more for farm animals.

&gt;Kenai Peninsula Borough Mayor Charlie Pierce has publicly backed the use of ivermectin, an anti-parasitic deworming drug, the Peninsula Clarion reported Wednesday.

&gt;Livestock supply stores in the borough, south of Anchorage, have received numerous inquiries about the drug in the recent weeks.

&gt;Pierce did not return calls to the Clarion nor The Associated Press.

&gt;He also didn’t answer an email sent by the AP asking how he heard about the drug, why he’s promoting it if he’s not a medical professional and if he would feel liable if someone were to become ill or worse taking it. **He also didn’t answer if he was vaccinated or if he was encouraging people in the borough, which has the fourth-worst vaccination rate in the state among boroughs, to get vaccinated.**

&gt;The borough has a population of nearly 59,000 residents, according to the U.S. Census, with the total cumulative case count at 6,153. There are currently 56 cases, and 24 of those people are hospitalized. All 11 intensive care unit hospital beds are occupied."
338,338,1629951828," &gt;Inmates at a jail in Arkansas were treated for COVID-19 with ivermectin, according to county officials at a finance and budget committee meeting Wednesday. Ivermectin is an anti-parasite drug commonly used for livestock that’s been erroneously used as a coronavirus treatment in recent weeks. The Food and Drug Administration and doctors strongly warn against it.

&gt;The realization the drug was used on inmates came after a county employee was tested for COVID-19, said a county official. The employee said they tested negative and were given a prescription of ivermectin.

&gt;The employee went to their primary care doctor who told them to throw it away.

&gt;“The employee had the good fortune of having a primary care physician to ask for a second opinion and our inmates do not have the choice,” said Eva Madison, Washington County Justice of the Peace.

&gt;Sheriff Tim Helder defended the jail’s health care partner, Karas Health, Wednesday.

snip

&gt;Karas Health Care made a Facebook post on July 16 that stated in part, “if anybody you know test positive send them our way and we’ll get them started on doxy, singular, ivermectin, vitamin d, vitamin c and zinc and do our best to keep them out of the hospital.”

&gt;A comment was made on the post and Karas Health Care responded with: “Yes we have been using ivermectin for prevention since January. I restarted for myself last week.”

&gt;The FDA warns against using the drug to treat COVID-19, stating: “FDA has not approved ivermectin for use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. Ivermectin tablets are approved at very specific doses for some parasitic worms, and there are topical (on the skin) formulations for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea. **Ivermectin is not an anti-viral (a drug for treating viruses).”**"

344,344,1629921457,"Here's the text of the op-ed:

---

Let’s talk for a minute about Lollapalooza. After canceling in-person events last year, a few weeks ago Chicago once again hosted the long-running music festival, drawing more than 385,000 people. Many feared that the huge, raucous crowds could produce a coronavirus superspreader event.

But the festival required proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test for entry, and it introduced indoor mask requirements halfway through. And very few people appear to have been infected.

What does this tell us? That the return to more or less normal life and its pleasures many expected Covid vaccines to deliver could have happened in the United States. The reason it hasn’t — the reason we are instead still living in fear, with hospitals in much of the South nearing breaking point — is that not enough people have been vaccinated and not enough people are wearing masks.

It’s possible to have sympathy for some of the unvaccinated, especially workers who find it hard to take time off to get a shot and are worried about losing a day to aftereffects. But there’s much less excuse for those who refuse to get their shots or wear masks for cultural or ideological reasons — and no excuse at all for MAGA governors like Ron DeSantis in Florida, Greg Abbott in Texas and Doug Ducey in Arizona who have been actively impeding efforts to contain the latest outbreak.

So how do you feel about anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers? I’m angry about their antics, even though I’m able to work from home and don’t have school-age children. And I suspect that many Americans share that anger.

The question is whether this entirely justified anger — call it the rage of the responsible — will have a political impact, whether leaders will stand up for the interests of Americans who are trying to do the right thing but whose lives are being disrupted and endangered by those who aren’t.

To say what should be obvious, getting vaccinated and wearing a mask in public spaces aren’t “personal choices.” When you reject your shots or refuse to mask up, you’re increasing my risk of catching a potentially deadly or disabling disease, and also helping to perpetuate the social and economic costs of the pandemic. In a very real sense, the irresponsible minority is depriving the rest of us of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Furthermore, to say something that should also be obvious, those claiming that their opposition to public health measures is about protecting “freedom” aren’t being honest.

Most notably, ever since masks became a front in the culture war it has been clear that many opponents of mask mandates aren’t merely demanding the right to go unmasked themselves — they want to stop others from acting responsibly. Tucker Carlson has called on his viewers to confront people they encounter who are wearing masks, and there have been scattered reports of violent attacks on mask-wearers.

Also, it’s striking how quickly supposed conservative principles have been abandoned wherever honoring those principles would help rather than hurt attempts to contain the pandemic.

For decades, conservatives have insisted that business owners should have the right to do as they please — to hire and fire at will, to deny service to whomever they choose. Yet here we have Abbott threatening to pull the liquor licenses of restaurants that ask for proof of vaccination, even as Texas runs out of I.C.U. beds.

Conservatives have also championed local control of education — except, it turns out, when school districts want to protect children with mask rules, in which case MAGA governors want to seize control and cut off their funding.

So the friends of Covid-19 aren’t motivated by love of freedom. I could offer some hypotheses about their real motives, but understanding what’s driving these people is less important than understanding how much harm they’re doing. That goes double for politicians who are cynically playing to the anti-vax, anti-mask crowd.

Recent polling suggests that the public strongly supports mask mandates and that an overwhelming majority of Americans opposes attempts to prevent local school districts from protecting children. I haven’t seen polling on attempts to prevent businesses from requiring proof of vaccination, but my guess is that these attempts are also unpopular.

But politicians like Abbott and DeSantis are catering to the anti-public health minority because it’s loud and angry, and they don’t think they’ll pay any political price.

Well, I think the pro-public health majority is also getting increasingly angry, and rightly so. It just hasn’t been vocal enough — and too few politicians have sought to tap into this righteous rage. (Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, is trying. He’s pointing out, correctly, that voting for his recall would probably install an anti-vaccine, anti-mask fanatic as governor, with dire consequences for the state.)

So it’s time to stop being diffident and call out destructive behavior for what it is. Doing so may make some people feel that they’re being looked down on. But you know what? Your feelings don’t give you the right to ruin other people’s lives."
345,345,1629914228,"Nah.  Trump wasn’t a great President.  He fucked up right out the gate and never had command of his people.  But I struggle to recall a debacle that comes close to the level of incompetence on display with Biden.  Got one?

346,346,1629911896,"I think that excess deaths data will be available in a year. Of course deaths from regular flu actually have decreased due to mask wearing, social distancing, closed venues and deaths from some other conditions have increased as people have self-deferred treatment due to fear of being exposed to covid in hospitals. And in some areas over the next month or so deaths from other causes will increase as covid-jammed er's and icu's are unable to take patients in a timely manner.

That's the shit part. We actually have to make things worse by leaving. This was such a disaster that it becomes a bigger disaster if we leave.

I remember when John Kerry ran against Bush in 2004, he lost in part because he didn't support the Republican's war enough. They gave Bush eight years to set up this death trap, and we spent the rest of our lives holding it together. And Biden has finally triggered the death trap.

Trump and the Republicans set a time for the withdrawal, they set this like a time bomb to blow up now in Biden's face. They gave the country away and let us deal with their self-deluded disaster.

And global warming has gotten out of control, and the delta variant. It's just endless disasters with these people.

The military and intelligence serve the civilian government. The fault lies with us, the people who elected these governments and made these decisions. The military and intelligence are tools our government is supposed to use for our benefit, and Republicans used these tools poorly.

But we’re working with China, just so you know, and other countries very, very closely. So it doesn’t get out of hand.

&gt; “You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed. And so that’s a very tricky one. That’s a very delicate one. It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flus … This is deadly stuff.”  — Trump, in an interview with journalist Bob Woodward, Feb 7, 2020


But he got right back on message quickly so as to not panic the stock market:


&gt; “Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. I hope that’s true. But we’re doing great in our country. China, I spoke with President Xi, and they’re working very, very hard. And I think it’s going to all work out fine.”   — Trump, at a campaign rally in Manchester, N.H., Feb 10, 2020

&gt; As we talk about children and COVID, we turn to top White House adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, who was speaking on NBC&amp;#039;s Meet the Press about the rise of COVID infection in kids and what can be done to protect them from the virus.

DeSantis' actions this week proves he couldn't care less about people catching Covid, with his order to not allow mask mandates and open up every business &amp; school, even though Florida cases are the worst in the nation.

458,458,1628551280,"Handy (and horrifying) comparison I discovered the other day: the mortality rate of mustard gas attacks in World War I is estimated at 2.5%.

So COVID's mortality rate is only a bit lower than poison gas attacks that made soldiers so afraid they pissed themselves in the trenches.

Many other gas weapons did have much higher lethality, like chlorine and phosgene, up to 24%. Mustard gas ""only"" inflicted long-term lung damage on many survivors, but it kept being used because it lingered in the area it was used for a long while after and because it had the benefit of not just taking soldiers out of the fight, but consuming hospital resources behind the lines caring for those ""only"" wounded by it.

But here's this fucker, saying that he'd *only* consider taking *any preventative action at all*...if the general population was subject to a worse mortality rate from COVID than being under a *constant chemical weapon attack.*

In the past, governors with presidential ambitions from either party would tell a story in which smarts, hard work, integrity and managerial acumen produced such extraordinary success in their state that they garnered admiration from all their constituents. Other GOP governors contemplating presidential runs, including Greg Abbott of Texas and Kristi L. Noem of South Dakota, will try to make a similar case for themselves."

468,468,1628441164,"Lately we've seen an increase in anti vac rhetoric from the far right. This has indeed dominated the news cycle because it is the newest cause for concern. It also has undoubtedly increased the amount of conservatives who are vaccine hesitant. 

You also have to consider that many conservatives have never had a problem with vaccines until just recently and when pressed many will admit hesitancy for only the COVID vaccine. So some of these people aren't anti-vax but anti-covid-vax specifically, because they are idiots, but it's not fully anti vax for all of them 

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/the-people-who-wont-get-the-vaccine/618765/

However, you can't just ignore then 10% or so of democrats that don't want the vaccine. Anti-vax misinformation is not party restricted and when considering racial inequalities and past exploitations, some people have reason to be untrusting of the vaccine.. not a logical reason but an emotional reason. 

https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/latest-data-on-covid-19-vaccinations-race-ethnicity/

It's hard for me to find any data on political party and anti-vax.percents at this time because of the anti-covid-vaccine movement has skewed those results. However, it is clear that more republicans are hesitant of COVID vax than democrats, but not everyone identifies as one of these two. Independents who often take up large portions of both parties, also have their group of anti-vaxers, which impacts the data."

474,474,1628294779,"I though covid was so harmless we didn't need to make people, especially unvaccinated children, wear masks?

Why is desantis accusing immigrants of attacking people with something he deemed harmless, hm?"
475,475,1628292120,"&gt;Ron DeSantis' push to stop school mask mandates plowed ahead on Friday despite a legal challenge from parents, with education officials enactinga rule to protect non-masked students from “COVID-19 harassment.” Florida’s Department of Health on Friday adopted an emergency rule allowing school districts to skirt rigid mask requirements for students, essentially giving kids the ability to “opt out” of any local mandates. Some parents who phoned in to Friday’s board meeting called this language “irresponsible” and “reckless,” while others said the rule fell short of protecting the freedom of students to attend school without masks."
476,476,1628286161,"&gt;Ms Pelosi had angered House Republicans by continuing with the mask mandate, before it was dropped at the start of June, when more members were fully vaccinated against Covid. The rules were then reintroduced following updated recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control last month, amid warnings of the more infectious Delta variant of Covid. According to the CDC, wearing a mask reduces the chances of transmitting Covid to others, while being fully vaccinated is enough to stop severe illness – but may not prevent transmission."

OP is claiming that laws to overturn elections have already been passed in dozens of states. That is untrue. Such a law was considered and withdrawn in just one state, Arizona, and has been talked about in a few others, but none have passed anywhere.

And of course I don't trust the GOP to do the right thing, ever. Even beyond becoming the pro-COVID party and killing Americans, they are now clearly devoted to overturning American democracy. They are an existential threat to the nation. 

As I've said elsewhere, my guess on the odds of at least one deep-red state passing a law before 2024 to effectively cancel popular elections and have the legislature simply award electoral votes as they please is approaching 100%. They'll justify that with more bullshit claims about how elections have gotten too corrupted to be trusted and how it's a temporary measure.

They are obviously going in that direction, and we all need to be working to stop this - because it *hasn't* happened yet and *there's still time and options to fight it*."

Ron DeSantis selling gear mocking Biden health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci and the soaring rates of COVID-19 in his state. The plan to sabotage the pandemic response and blame Biden was backfiring.

&gt; That was when Republicans and their propagandists at Fox News decided to strategically put out some mealy-mouthed pro-vaccine sentiments. A clip from Sean Hannity, where the Fox News host offered a superficially pro-vaccine sentiment, went viral, fueled by journalists and liberals who are desperate for any sign that Republicans are giving up on this anti-vaccine thing. What people who championed the clip didn't know, however, was that it came from a larger segment on Hannity's show that was overall negative about vaccination, and was sandwiched by two other popular shows that were also anti-vaccine."

The good news is that — even though Republican disinformation on vaccines has not let up — the uptick in cases and hospitalizations (virtually all among unvaccinated people) in red-state areas has permeated the right-wing media echo chamber."

520,520,1627955527,"Here's the text of the op-ed:

---

Ron DeSantis, governor of Florida, isn’t stupid. He is, however, ambitious and supremely cynical. So when he says things that sound stupid it’s worth asking why. And his recent statements on Covid-19 help us understand why so many Americans are still dying or getting severely ill from the disease.

The background here is Florida’s unfolding public health catastrophe.

We now have highly effective vaccines freely available to every American who is at least 12 years old. There has been a lot of hype about “breakthrough” infections associated with the Delta variant, but they remain rare, and serious illness among the vaccinated is rarer still. There is no good reason we should still be suffering severely from this pandemic.

But Florida is in the grip of a Covid surge worse than it experienced before the vaccines. More than 10,000 Floridians are hospitalized, around 10 times the number in New York, which has about as many residents; an average of 58 Florida residents are dying each day, compared with six in New York. And the Florida hospital system is under extreme stress.

There’s no mystery about why this has happened. At every stage of the pandemic DeSantis has effectively acted as an ally of the coronavirus, for example by issuing orders blocking businesses from requiring that their patrons show proof of vaccination and schools from requiring masks. More generally, he has helped create a state of mind in which vaccine skepticism flourishes and refusal to take precautions is normalized.

One technical note: Florida’s vaccination rate is well below the rates in the Northeast, but closely matches the national average. But seniors are much more likely to be vaccinated than younger Americans, in Florida as elsewhere; and Florida, of course, has an unusually high number of seniors. Among younger groups the state lags behind the nation as a whole, and even further behind blue states.

So, given these grim developments, one might have expected or at least hoped that DeSantis would reconsider his position. In fact, he has been making excuses — it’s all about the air-conditioning! He has been claiming that any new restrictions would have unacceptable costs for the economy — although Florida’s recent performance looks terrible if you place any value on human life.

Above all, he has been playing the liberal-conspiracy-theory card, with fund-raising letters declaring that the “radical left” is “coming for your freedom.”

So let’s talk about what the right means when it talks about “freedom.” Since the pandemic began, many conservatives have insisted that actions to limit the death toll — social distancing, wearing a mask and now getting vaccinated — should be matters of personal choice. Does that position make any sense?

Well, driving drunk is also a personal choice. But almost everyone understands that it’s a personal choice that endangers others; 97 percent of the public considers driving while impaired by alcohol a serious problem. Why don’t we have the same kind of unanimity on refusing to get vaccinated, a choice that helps perpetuate the pandemic and puts others at risk?

True, many people doubt the science; the link between vaccine refusal and Covid deaths is every bit as real as the link between D.U.I. and traffic deaths, but is less obvious to the naked eye. But why are people on the right so receptive to misinformation on this subject, and so angry about efforts to set the record straight?

My answer is that when people on the right talk about “freedom” what they actually mean is closer to “defense of privilege” — specifically the right of certain people (generally white male Christians) to do whatever they want.

Not incidentally, if you go back to the roots of modern conservatism, you find people like Barry Goldwater defending the right of businesses to discriminate against Black Americans. In the name of freedom, of course. A lot, though not all, of the recent panic about “cancel culture” is about protecting the right of powerful men to mistreat women. And so on.

Once you understand that the rhetoric of freedom is actually about privilege, things that look on the surface like gross inconsistency and hypocrisy start to make sense.

Why, for example, are conservatives so insistent on the right of businesses to make their own decisions, free from regulation — but quick to stop them from denying service to customers who refuse to wear masks or show proof of vaccination? Why is the autonomy of local school districts a fundamental principle — unless they want to require masks or teach America’s racial history? It’s all about whose privilege is being protected.

The reality of what the right means by freedom also, I think, explains the special rage induced by rules that impose some slight inconvenience in the name of the public interest — like the detergent wars of a few years back. After all, only poor people and minority groups are supposed to be asked to make sacrifices.

Anyway, as you watch DeSantis invoke “freedom” to escape responsibility for his Covid catastrophe, remember, when he says it, that word does not mean what you think it means."

531,531,1627924563,"&gt; So science works by the CDC lying to us, showing us no data, and switching their story without explanation? 

You clearly have never looked. If you want information about vaccine effectiveness studies by the CDC, [you can look here](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm?s_cid=mm7013e3_w).

If you would like information on the study about how the Delta variant can still be spread by vaccinated individuals, [you can look here](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s_cid=mm7031e2_w).

None of this is difficult to find. All of the studies and data are available to you right now. You just need to take the time to read it.

&gt; The CDC data out of Massachusetts said 75% of breakthrough cases were in the vaccinated. Massachusetts is 50% vaccinate.

Correct. But none of those breakthrough cases died, 4 needed hospitalization. The vaccine isn't 100% effective.

This new information is why the CDC is now advising universal mask use. The delta variant can still spread through vaccinated individuals.

The purpose of the vaccine is to prevent severe illness and death. All the trials used the same criteria with two explicit goals: prevent infection, and prevent severe disease. [You can find this under 'efficacy' criteria from the original papers](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577).

&gt;  Confirmed Covid-19 was defined according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria as the presence of at least one of the following symptoms: fever, new or increased cough, new or increased shortness of breath, chills, new or increased muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, diarrhea, or vomiting, combined with a respiratory specimen obtained during the symptomatic period or within 4 days before or after it that was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid amplification–based testing, either at the central laboratory or at a local testing facility (using a protocol-defined acceptable test).

&gt; Major secondary end points included the efficacy of BNT162b2 against severe Covid-19. Severe Covid-19 is defined by the FDA as confirmed Covid-19 with one of the following additional features: clinical signs at rest that are indicative of severe systemic illness; respiratory failure; evidence of shock; significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction; admission to an intensive care unit; or death. Details are provided in the protocol.

Pfizer was 95% effective in trials for the first criteria, and 99% for the latter criteria. This beat FDA's original emergency use authorization ctieria out of the water.

&gt; These results met our prespecified success criteria, which were to establish a probability above 98.6% of true vaccine efficacy being greater than 30%, and greatly exceeded the minimum FDA criteria for authorization.

You can find the original EUA criteria [here](https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download). Specifically, you want section C.3 page 10.

&gt; For a preventive COVID19 vaccine to be potentially administered to millions of individuals, including healthy individuals, data adequate to inform an assessment of the vaccine’s benefits and risks and support issuance of an EUA would include not only meeting the prespecified success criteria for the study’s primary efficacy endpoint as described in the guidance for industry entitled “Development and Licensure of Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19” (Ref. 1) (i.e. a point estimate for a placebo controlled efficacy trial of at least 50%, with a lower bound of the appropriately alpha-adjusted confidence interval around the primary efficacy endpoint point estimate of &gt;30%) but also additional safety and effectiveness data as described below.

For a full breakdown of the stipulated criteria you can find that [here](https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download).

You really couldn’t figure that one out on your own?"
533,533,1627919419,"That is not the answer.  That is a separate unrelated question. 

Does the vaccine protect from hospitalization and severe illness? 

That answer is

&gt;While numerous studies have shown that the vaccines don't work as well against the delta variant as they did against other strains, health officials say they are still highly effective, especially in protecting against severe illness and death. Roughly 97% of new hospitalizations and 99.5% of deaths in the U.S. are among unvaccinated individuals, U.S. health officials repeated this week.

My question

 why in a  population 50% vaccinated does 75% of positive cases come from the 50% that are vaccinated?  

The articles clear that the vaccine is preventing hospitalization and I never asked about that.

Do you understand the difference between catching covid and getting severely sick from covid?"
534,534,1627918682,"&gt;NOBODY ever said vaccines were 100% effective

Yup, an I didn't either. The FDA said 95% effective at stopping the spread. I posted the link in my other comment. 
Please try and keep up with the discussion. Building strawman's to argue with is not useful. 

&gt;A vaccine has to be applied to a whole group of people to be effective, 

Data and the science says otherwise. In vaccinated people according to the CDC and Fauci, the virus inhabits the nasal area where the vaccine immunity has little impact. In unvaccinated people it spreads to the body and can kill them. In vaccinated people it does not. They need to develop a vaccine nasal spray to fox this.  That is all according to our government health agencies.  


&gt;but ONLY if these fucking antivaxxers just shut up and get the shot. How many more people have to die?

The only people at risk of dying are the unvaccinated. If they do that then it's their choice and if they die it's not your fault or my fault. Since vaccinated people can spread the virus you can not blame any spread just on unvaccinated people. It pretty much made vaccinated people into carriers of covid since they won't have any symptoms but still can spread it unknowingly.  
This is a nightmare brewing but people are failing to realize it just yet."
535,535,1627918175,"&gt;That is how science works

So science works by the CDC lying to us, showing us no data, and switching their story without explanation?  

Maybe to you guys who part of the 'trust the science ' mantra when science has a very diverse set of views that are contradictory.  


&gt;New data from the delta variant shows that it might be only 50% effective at preventing the spread.

The CDC data out of Massachusetts said 75% of breakthrough cases were in the vaccinated. Massachusetts is 50% vaccinate.  
That's not 50% effective in preventing the spread. 
But you believe in the cult of science, not actual science.  

&gt;The purpose of the vaccine as laid out by the FDA is to prevent 'severe disease' aka hospitalization and death.

This is from the FDA website. 
https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-frequently-asked-questions
&gt;The vaccine was 95 percent effective in preventing COVID-19 disease among these clinical trial participants with 8 COVID-19 cases in the vaccine group and 162 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group. Of these 170 COVID-19 cases, 1 in the vaccine group and 3 in the placebo group were classified as severe.

So you are wrong.  Please try and inform yourself on the topic. 

&gt;Thanks for getting vaccinated. It does help, and it might save your arse.

yeah, I hate this take as well.

NOBODY ever said vaccines were 100% effective.
That's why we should never think about vaccines as someone selling an individual person a cure-all.

A vaccine has to be applied to a whole group of people to be effective, to reduce disease spread. It does help, it's better than a mask, and might possibly prevent us from returning to ""social distancing"" and shutdowns, but ONLY if these fucking antivaxxers just shut up and get the shot.

We should have tested people for natural immunity and dosed them last if they wanted. The science is unclear but it might have been counterproductive to vax people who had immunity.

I don't agree with your stance, but here's an alternative view.

The game was rigged against the clueless students. They were told/sold **Santa Claus fantasies** about how their educations would allow them to pay back massive loans. Everyone was in on the lie/con job: Banks, the colleges, HS guidance counselors, the gov't/politicians, media, economists -- everyone. The rich bought politicians so the students can not even default on their loans via bankruptcy (thanks to politicians like Joe Biden!).

It was a rigged game and the students were the patsies/victims.

The clueless students should have rebelled. They should have **organized** and protested, stopping their payments.

Many are in default, thanks to COVID-19 and our fake sham of an economy.

For the students that struggled and paid off their loans? Good for those clueless people -- they get a [Horatio Alger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger) award and a good credit score from some thankless corporation.

But meanwhile back in reality, we have a totally f\*cked society. Our gap between the rich and poor is obscene.

We have **an entire generation** that is too poor to buy homes or to generate our ""consumer society"" that we were told was our hallmark.

Banksters and investors are now buying up homes and putting run-of-the-mill single family homes into ""bonds"". The entire US is transforming not into a nation where ""we the people"" own homes/property, but where the rich own the land and we have **huge masses** of people who are permanent renters.

That's a radical transformation of US society going on without our noticing!

Karl Marx predicted this over a century ago, talking about the ""working class"" as ""proletarians-"" -- the class in ancient Roman society that were citizens but who owned nothing but could only sell their labor for enough food to survive. That's what the US is **devolving** into today.

FDR faced something similar in the Great Depression. Then FDR forced the banksters to **write down the principle of their loans** -- the banksters lost big money but US capitalism was saved. Obama bailed the banksters out in 2008/9 and a Democrat president watched *millions of Americans lose their homes* without doing much but give feel-good speeches. (And we wonder why we got Trump!)

So what are we going to do?

* Stick with ""conventional politics"" and watch the US *further* erode into an oligarchy where the rich own everything -- and wait for a revolution?

* Or do something out-of-the-box and attempt to rescue capitalism again?

&gt;While she’s thrilled to have the game-changing vaccine, only roughly 30% of Jefferson County is vaccinated. Unlike last year during a similar rise in cases, she feels she doesn’t have the political buy-in from her area for mitigation measures like masking. **Candidates for her local school board ran and won on the idea of eliminating mask mandates in schools.**

&gt;Vollmar also warned about a lack of funding for contact tracers and other public health measures needed for the wave she worries is coming. Funding has been slow to reach local health departments, much as it was last year when **some county commissioners around the state withheld funding for local departments, angry about lockdowns and other restrictions.

Absolutely true. Rand Paul is totally right here.  Fauci DID lie and is directly and PERSONALLY responsible for 4 million deaths.  He had Trump lift the ban on GOF research funding.  They couldn't do the research in the USA though because the law doesn't allow it so Fauci and friends helped secure funding for the Wuhan Lab which was WOEFULLY unqualified to handle level 4 Biohazard organisms.

Yet they are still passing laws banning mask and vaccine mandates for schools and, in some cases, even workplaces. In the state of Florida, where 20% of all the current new cases are, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis is running for re-election selling beer koozies that say ""Don't Fauci My Florida.""

Sure, that sounds sane.

For the rest - who said anything about burning down courthouses or looting clothing stores being an exercise of the First Amendment? Tens of millions of people protested for an end to racist policing and the betterment of this country, but you ignore that and instead want us to pay attention to a handful of unrelated criminals who had convenient scapegoats for their actions?

Remember Rudy talking about stolen Rolexes that were never stolen? Remember ""anarchist jurisdictions?"" Remember Portland being burned to the ground, to the surprise of its citizens that never noticed?)

I find that it's best to label fascists as fascists. It makes clear the stakes.

In previous decades (say, the Nixon administration through the second Bush administration), Republicans only winked at authoritarian tendencies and occasionally kept their racism to a simmer. Now? It's full-boil fascism. Poll workers get death threats. Companies that speak against the party line by saying such controversial things as ""racism is bad, and voting should be encouraged"" results in boycotts and Republicans trying to use the power of whatever government they can against those companies. Protests against police murders result not in police reform, but in the legalizing of murdering protesters with your car.  Republicans insist that the only possible legitimate outcome of elections is them winning.

Open musings about just cancelling the election and holding power forever. Statements that he'd ignore the Constitution and remain President into the 2040s even if he deigned to allow elections. The response to people exercising their first amendment right to protest was met with hatred, violence, and the threat of the military being unleashed upon the crowds. Citizens were disappeared off the street without arrest or trial. Cities that politically displeased the President got labeled ""anarchist jurisdictions."" States were threatened for even trying to protect their citizens from COVID. PPE supplies were stolen by armed federal agents and states started having to band together against the federal government, bringing our entire system of government to the brink of collapse. 200,000 Americans were dead with no end in sight.

Excuses can be made for 2016. Maybe people thought it was all a big joke, thought he couldn't possibly win, thought our democratic system could take whatever abuses were heaped upon it. Those are stupid excuses, but they can at least be imagined.

2020, though? We all knew what was at stake. Literally every one of us. Anyone who says otherwise is simply lying.

Misinformation has caused confusion and led people to decline COVID-19 vaccines, reject public health measures such as masking and physical distancing, and use unproven treatments. The report urges media companies to “Implement product design and policy changes on technology platforms to slow the spread of misinformation.” Unfortunately, that has not been the case at Facebook and some right-wing outlets, which are incentivized to seek clicks and eyeballs, even with lies."

Which is what I said.

Because that's what's happening right now.

This is not ""violent metaphor"". I did not call for murder or demand vengeance. I gave an accurate fucking depiction of the current situation using metaphor which is coincidentally relating to death because the fucking party is dying, both metaphorically as I have described here and quite literally as vaccination rates stagnate and decline, with red states being the least vaccinated overall, and way more than 90% of COVID-19 deaths now occuring in unvaccinated populations."

Instead of merely canceling all of the Covid-19 vaccinations they chose to eliminate all (yes, that means every vaccination) for school age kids."
648,648,1626232265,"You're right, there's a non-zero chance she died of something other than Covid.  I mean, it's almost zero, but yeah, he hasn't confirmed that what's 99.99% most likely to have happened is actually what happened.

That's still not cherry-picking, it's just assuming that the most likely cause is the actual cause when there's a .01% chance it's not.  An *assumption* is not the same thing as *cherry-picking*.  Cherry-picking is when you select the rare case and present it as the normal case.  If this lady *didn't* die of covid, then she'd be a cherry-picked case of people that had covid, were on a vent, but didn't die of it.  More likely she died of covid and is just one more of hundreds of thousands (in the US; out of millions in the world.)  In that case, her case isn't cherry-picked --- she's just one more idiot that died of covid instead of getting the vaccine.

Contrast that with the kid you presented, who has a very high percentage chance of having died of something other than the vaccine, but even if it DOES turn out he died of the vaccine, he'd be ""one more death out of tens"" (if it's even that many), compared to this lady, who will be ""one more death out of hundreds of thousands"".  Just the fact that he died after getting the vaccine --- no matter the cause --- makes his case cherry-picked because it's so far from the norm.  But if it turns out he *did* die of the vaccine, which I doubt, then his will be a doubly-cherry-picked case."

But you go right on believing the report will come back and say she died of a bullet to the head, or from blunt force trauma from the bus that hit her, or whatever else imagined harm you can come up with that isn't a death caused by complications of Covid.

Ironically, if it turns out she *didn't* die of Covid and was assassinated instead, you'll have the perfect cherry-picked case of someone who had Covid, was on a vent, and died of *something else* to throw in people's faces."

Let's be clear: she didn't get Covid, recover, and THEN die.  She died WITH Covid, while intubated, in the hospital.

Suppose she *didn't* have a pre-existing condition and died of complications of Covid like other healthy people do.  Well, then, nothing surprising there, right?  But suppose her friends are right and she *did* have a preexisting condition, what difference does that make?  A person with a pre-existing cardiac problem that does nothing to prevent themselves from getting a disease that is known to attack the vascular system is *doubly stupid.*

That's like saying, ""well, he knew he had high blood pressure and heart disease, but I don't think the rack of BBQ ribs he ate every day, nor the 5 beers he drank every night, nor his total lack of exercise, nor the salty snacks he ate daily, had anything to do with his heart attack, because, after all, he had pre-existing high blood pressure and heart disease and *that's* what killed him, not all the crap he ate despite knowing his condition.""

That's like saying, ""well, I know my truck can haul 3 tons, and it's already got 2.95 tons in the bed, but I'm not going to stop you from adding that extra 2 tons of material.""  And then when your truck breaks down saying, ""oh, well, it wasn't the 2 tons of material that was added, it was the 2.95 tons of crap that was *already in there* that ruined the truck!""

This lady was out there saying, ""forget what your cardiologist told you, keep eating those ribs.  Ignore your truck's manual, go ahead and load that baby down with 5.95 tons of material.

Berenson did not take the responsibility to check his numbers—Biden’s goal was 70 percent with at least one dose by July 4, and we’re now at roughly 56 percent—but the result is that the audience, upon hearing that a goal of President Biden’s has not been met, simply erupts into enthusiastic applause. This roomful of adult human beings puts its hands together for more death. 

Traitor Trump should be cheering the fact that he poured huge sums of money into Big Pharma to develop the current vaccines. (That's right, *we the people* paid to develop the COVID-19 vaccines, but the gov't allowed Big Pharma to patent them and charge outrageous prices for them. Now since poor countries cannot afford the vaccines we're seeing all of the variants/mutations evolve.)

But instead Trump has told so many lies about the virus and spun it so hard that it's trivial, that he cannot or does not take credit for what was one of his wasteful but intelligent moves while he was president.

&gt;""It was my job to provide evidence-based education and vaccine access so that Tennesseans could protect themselves against COVID-19,"" Fiscus said in a written statement. ""I have now been terminated for doing exactly that.""

&gt;Sarah Tanksley, a spokesperson for the health department, said the agency would not comment on the termination.

&gt;IN HER WORDS: Read Dr. Michelle Fiscus' scathing statement after termination: 'I am afraid for my state'

&gt;Fiscus took heat for teenage vaccinations

&gt;Republican lawmakers began to criticize Fiscus by name during a contentious hearing of the Joint Government Operations Committee on June 16.

&gt;**Lawmakers were angry about a letter Fiscus sent to medical providers who administer vaccines explaining the state's “Mature Minor Doctrine,” a legal mechanism by which they are allowed to vaccinate minors above the age of 14 without consent from their parents.**

&gt;The letter was sent in response to questions from vaccine providers but did not contain new information. The **details of the Mature Minor Doctrine have been publicly available on the health department’s website since at least 2008. The doctrine was established in 1987**, according to the health department.

&gt;Fiscus said the language in the letter was provided to her by the health department's attorney, who said at the time it had been ""blessed by the governor's office.""

&gt;At the June 16 hearing, Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey said to her knowledge the doctrine had only been invoked eight times this year. Three of those instances involved her own kids, who were vaccinated while she was at work, she said.

&gt;Lawmakers were still angry. Sen. Janice Bowling, R-Tullahoma, who repeatedly has spread vaccine misinformation during legislative hearings, insisted the state was misinterpreting its legal authority.

snip

&gt;Later in the same hearing, another lawmaker, Sen. Mark Pody, R-Lebanon, cited ""extreme disappointment"" the health department would allow children to be vaccinated through the Mature Minor Doctrine. Lawmakers later discussed dissolving the entire agency to stop it from promoting vaccines to teens.

&gt;Since this June hearing, the health department has steadily backed down from its efforts to vaccinate minors. The agency halted all online vaccination outreach to teens and deleted Facebook and Twitter posts that gently recommended vaccines to anyone over the age of 12. Internal emails obtained by The Tennessean revealed agency leaders ordered county-level staff not to hold any vaccination events intended specifically for adolescents."

670,670,1626107233,"Here Richard Delgado describes Critical Race Theory's ""colonization"" of Education:

&gt;DELGADO: We didn't set out to colonize, but found a natural affinity in education. In education, race neutrality and color-blindness are the reigning orthodoxy. Teachers believe that they treat their students equally. Of course, the outcome figures show that they do not. If you analyze the content, the ideology, the curriculum, the textbooks, the teaching methods, they are the same. But they operate against the radically different cultural backgrounds of young students. Seeing critical race theory take off in education has been a source of great satisfaction for the two of us. Critical race theory is in some ways livelier in education right now than it is in law, where it is a mature movement that has settled down by comparison.

Here is Gloria Ladson Billings citing Richard Delgado while describing her introduction of Critical Race Theory to the field of Education:

&gt;Almost five years ago a colleague and I began a collaboration in which we grappled with the legal scholarship known as ""critical race theory"" (Delgado, cited in Monaghan, 1993). So tentative were we about this line of inquiry that we proceeded with extreme caution. We were both untenured and relatively new to our institution. We were unsure of how this new line of inquiry would be received both within our university and throughout the educational research scholarly community. Our initial step was to hold a colloquium in our department. We were pleasantly surprised to meet with a room filled with colleagues and graduate students who seemed eager to hear our ideas and help us in these new theoretical and conceptual formulations.

&gt;After speaking on varying teaching strategies, Dr. Ladson-Billings introduced audience members to the concept of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy, a form of teaching practice she coined that is designed to empower students intellectually, socially, emotionally and politically through the use of “cultural referents” that drive them towards success.

---

Last Tuesday President Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers published a blog post warning everyone not to make too much of any one month’s employment report. It presumably released this in advance of Friday’s report to fend off possible accusations that it was just trying to make excuses for a weak number. As it happened, however, the report came in strong: The economy added an impressive 850,000 jobs.

The job gain was especially impressive given widespread claims that businesses couldn’t expand because generous unemployment benefits were discouraging workers from taking jobs. (Recent benefit cuts in many states came too late to have affected this report.) Well, somehow employers are managing to hire a lot of people anyway.

Oh, and so much for Donald Trump’s warnings that there would be a “Biden depression” if he weren’t re-elected.

That said, the council’s points were well taken. Covid-19 created huge dislocations in the economy, and as we recover from these dislocations economic data are unusually noisy — largely because the standard adjustments statisticians make to smooth out things like seasonal variation don’t work well in an economy still distorted by the pandemic.

At this point, however, we have enough data in hand to declare that the economy is booming. In fact, it’s booming so strongly that Republicans have pivoted from claiming (falsely) that we’re experiencing the worst job performance in decades to lauding the employment numbers and giving credit to … Trump’s 2017 tax cut.

Back to that in a minute. First, let’s try to put this boom in context, by noting that the economy is running hotter than it did during the “Morning in America” boom that gave Ronald Reagan a landslide victory in the 1984 presidential election.

We’ve gained three million jobs since Biden took office, or 600,000 jobs a month. This compares with gains of 340,000 a month in the year leading up to the 1984 election.

To be fair, Reagan-era job gains took place from a lower base, so it may be more appropriate to compare growth rates. But this still gives Biden the advantage: 5 percent at an annual rate, versus 4.4 percent in 1983-84. And the disparity grows if you compare jobs with the working-age population, which was growing around 1 percent a year in the 1980s but has stagnated in recent years.

So it’s a boom. What’s behind it?

The Republican determination to attribute everything good that happens to tax cuts is almost beyond parody. Some of us still remember how practically everyone in the G.O.P. predicted disaster after Bill Clinton raised taxes, then, when he presided over prosperity instead, declared that the boom of the late 1990s was a result of Reagan’s tax cuts in the early 1980s. Of course, they’re now insisting that good news in mid-2021 is somehow a vindication of stuff Trump did almost four years earlier.

The truth is that Reagan doesn’t even deserve much credit for the boom of 1983-84; most of the credit should go instead to the Federal Reserve, which slashed interest rates in 1982.

But how much credit should Biden get for job growth in 2021? Not all of it, certainly, but quite a lot.

The American Rescue Plan, which greatly increased the purchasing power of American consumers, has surely been an important driver of growth. Even more important, however, has been the rapid rise in vaccination rates, which has led to a plunge in the infection and death rates. Some of us predicted long ago that the U.S. would experience a rapid, “V-shaped” recovery once the pandemic subsided and the economy could reopen; well, the success of the vaccination drive has brought us to that moment.

And political leadership has had a lot to do with rapid vaccination. Yes, the vaccines themselves were developed before Biden took office, and the Trump administration had ordered millions of doses. But the Biden administration took much stronger steps than its predecessor had to coordinate vaccine distribution and get shots into arms.

More generally, anyone who doubts the importance of political leadership in progress against Covid-19 should look at the differences in vaccination rates across states, which have a stunning correlation with partisanship: States that voted for Biden have been much more successful than Trump states in getting their residents vaccinated.

So yes, we are having another morning in America, and Biden deserves more credit for his good morning than Reagan ever did for his.

Obviously things could still go wrong. Vaccination rates have slowed down, in part because of resistance in red states, and the large number of still-unvaccinated Americans makes a wave of new outbreaks possible. Also, while I’m in the camp that sees the current inflation as a transitory problem, we could be wrong.

Above all, short-run economic success is no guarantee of good long-term results. Many people have forgotten the widespread economic despair that prevailed just a few years after Reagan’s triumphalism.

But right now the economic news is good. And Joe Biden has every right to crow about it."
686,686,1625495855,"I dont feel bad for him. He is being viewed by millions as a hero who he does not deserve. Before Covid, he had a questionable history. His work on AIDs, HIV, and AZT being the most well-known controversy. Now if anyone questions him they get labeled as attacking science or conspiracy theories. Fauci has said attacks on him are attacks on science and then refused to show the science behind his actions people are attacking.
When we saw Trump up there behaving like an idiot the juxtaposition of Fauci gave us an easy symbol to latch on to. When we have a horrible leader an average leader looks great. 

Just look at what the other comment to yours said 

&gt;He never once stopped doing his job when Trump tried to silence him, 

It's not about the science to people who support him but it's about being on the right team. 

The claim by him 

&gt;We do have a countermeasure that's highly, highly effective. And that's the reason why it's all the sadder, all the more tragic,"" he said. ""Whatever the reason—some of it is ideologic, some of it is fundamentally anti-vaxxer, anti-science—but we just need to put that aside now.

We do have highly effective countermeasures but for some reason, people in charge seem to be opposed to using them. He is also calling people who are concerned about this specific vaccine anti-vaxxers and antiscience. Some scientists question the safety of these vaccines from a scientific position. Fauci is being anti-science. He could address the reasons but instead, he must insult them. 
From when he said masks were silly I realized he was not what the media claimed. At the same time, he did that my state was saying there was a shortage of masks and to donate medical-grade ones to the hospitals and wear a cloth mask. 
He has never pointed to where the science changed here.  He has given multiple explanations. One is he was trying to save PPE for first responders, second is the science changed. The data early on was that SARS Covid 1 was transmitted asymptotic and a certain drug that Trump mentioned was helpful. We never had any data one way or another on SARS covid 2. So why not error on the side of caution and follow the SARS covid 1 protocol which said even cloth masks work. 
I blame Trump first. His style of leadership was not what we needed and created distrust in what he said.  I dont think we should give people a pass because Trump was so bad."

Cases where staff are seeking information on the Covid-19 pandemic or harms to labor or small businesses will also only need one commissioner’s approval.

&gt;While Khan and her allies styled the resolutions as “streamlining” investigations, they actually have a more strategic value for the Democrats.

&gt;Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra is likely to leave in the coming months because President Joe Biden has nominated him to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Once he departs, the FTC will be equally split between Republicans and Democrats until Biden nominates and the Senate confirms a fifth member. Thursday’s change ensures that the Republican commissioners can’t block investigations the Democrats want to open.

Smart. Now the agency can’t be handcuffed by Republican Senators if they try and delay confirmation."

If covid came out of a lab researching sickle cell because it developed in a test animal and zoonotic transmission occurs that's not remotely the same as claiming it was engineered or cultivated. A virus coming from a lab that doesn't have anything to do with corona virus's would mean it coming from a lab is extraneous, inconsequential information."
711,711,1623895932,"E: I gave him the benefit of the doubt for a while. This guy's just angry at China. Seriously, focusing so strongly on a scapegoat just blinds all of us to failures **we** had control over. No excuses. America and China both fucked up significantly and in different ways. Blaming China unjustly absolves *our* mistakes. And most of all It suggests intent and/or carelessness was responsible for the pandemic and that's just way too fuckin reductive. It is a **SLIM** chance this was from a lab.

I'll number my answers to match your paragraphs.

1. I mean no offense, but I'm not telling. TMI for Reddit.

2. That's what I remember

3. Correct. Small chance is not zero.

4. Eh, kinda. You can cultivate but that presents its own problems and would've likely left its own evidence.

5. Cultivation isn't nearly that easy. If I wanted to cultivate a virus like covid I'd start with some bats.

6. No, because trustworthy sources aren't going to give you a definite answer this early.

7. Since the side effects are extremely rare I'd have to say its almost certainly a greater chance. It's not easily calculable. The chance is low because when we sequenced its genome there weren't any signs it was manipulated.

8. A 1% chance warrants investigation. We're expending the capital because it's necessary to prove. It's necessary to prove in no small part due to the geopolitical turmoil caused by laying blame so heavily at China's feet. We have to prove it didn't come from the lab or else people will demand retribution unjustly. We have to prove it did come from a lab if we're going to hold China accountable for it at all. They fucked up some, no doubt, but the fuck up was trying to rug sweep it not crafting it.

9. I'm well aware of superpowers using their influence to evade accountability, that's *part* of why I'm saying we should hold off on *just* blaming China. Scapegoating China would be a very easy method of absolving ourselves of *our* accountability and it's unfair to claim China owns all of the blame.

The honest likelihood covid-19 came from a lab is very fuckin small. Does that mean we shouldn't investigate the possibility? No. Investigate away. It's just not likely this was engineered, so don't get too disappointed if the source is bats.

 They want tax free living just like all the other ultra wealthy aristocrats. Isolate every church from every dollar and watch how quickly they will start doing their duty in their communities. Be like sister act 3 probably quicker. 

 And in public school science should be taught not creationism.

 When if they read what he said he said we are all gods, all of us children of the most high. So we need to evolve more and be gods. We are at that point I technology and science where we could fix all the world's problems if the idiocy and ideology of the past that contradicts every aspect of life and living well would just stay out of public policy. 

 The church was the antithesis to what Jesus taught. Peter was the antichrist that's why he was crucified upsidedown. Yet his church of false prophets and popes cherry pick doctrines to translate however they want over millennia with kings to rule our morality with. The bible is whisper down the lane and the message is so lost by now nobody gets it. Yet Americans swear by it as the word of God. Idolizing a book, a building, an outdated doctrine that has caused nothing but disease and war and famine and hell to this earth. 

Tax the church, sue the church, file a suit against God for all his atrocities. Then redistribute the Vatican gold to worthy projects in communities for people that need it.

In America we have gotten ourselves into a bad spot. Corporations have too much influence over politics and our representatives do not necessarily represent us but try and dictate to us what our laws should be based on their beliefs and/or special interests.  We have a TON of corruption in our leadership right out out in front of us but we are either to battered down by stress and over working to see what is going on right in front of us. Also... we have our fair share of really uneducated/just plain stupid people.  these elites just want to keep power and make money. They work for and represent the investor and nothing else. So big problem. 

These same companies and people feed a mentality and hire managers, CEOs and other boss types that have a me first/only thought process.  They push their employees to work harder and more hours. I for one work in IT. I collapsed a couple of weeks back and broke my hand in two places among other injuries.  Now I have been working with Doctors to track some health issues for several years (at great expense, with insurance, from my wife who works at a hospital... MERICA!). So its been no secret I've been struggling some. all this time i have still worked 60 to 80 hours a week. i take vacation - I'm on call, I'm sick - I'm on call, i collapse and break my self - who cares not their problem ( i have heard this sentiment from clients). Some might say, wow.. that sucks... you should quit! well if it were that simple i would have already. I'm the bread winner and as most working class families we both have to work full time to pay off bills for medical care, mortgage , college, Kids needs and other stuff we need to live. I didn't answer my phone for an unexpected call t 12:30 am in the morning from an Indian support center working on something for the client? Get a call from client bitching me out about it and then goes off on me for not be available the previous day during my Dr appt. for a few hrs in the morning where I found out I have MS.  But like I said, not their problem, because they don't want to hear it.  I should be available 24/7, We IT guys don't eat, sleep or even heal.  But even then, the problem was put down on her by her boss who doesn't wan to hear it and just wants what they want done with out any understanding of what it takes to do it. they will push and cause stress down the line just to squeeze out more money. 

Now that is just my example and yes, I am quitting and even moving away from this area. But you can see this on a larger scale when you just look at stuff like Amazon workers and the ridiculous time constraints they get put under causing stress and health issues.  Hospitals, my wife saw it at work with how they were being treated, getting benefits cut every year and lack of protections and care for staff and I am not even taking about COVID. COVID was another beast on its own. 

You want to know how trickle down economics worked out? They kept the money up top and gave us all stress and health issues. The sad thing is, they pit us against each other to hide the fact that they are pulling the stings. So quit your job? why? so i can go somewhere else, start all over for less. because that is what it looks like out there? so go back to school, get more certs? With what money? I'm trying to get out of debt not add even more horribly expensive school debt. Plus i have to work so much to make ends meet when can i do all of this with out just not working? 

I have been seeing Americans being kept at lower wages across massive industries. Being put into debt just trying to live or get a better life. Meanwhile our ""representatives"" whittle away at our rights to vote and make decisions for ourselves just so they can maintain power and money. 

  Don't get me wrong, I am not blaming any political party because at this point those in power positions in America has taught us that we should not trust them. Sadly that trickled down to, to our own police. They are supposed to be our community peace officers and instead power high, under trained people who don't know the law they are supposed uphold are being hired. 

America is broken. I am so tired and need change.  Its a big risk but we have decided for my health I have to quit. Selling our home, paying off all debt and moving to a more affordable area/state. But to have change a lot more people will have to realize what has been happening, speak out, and vote out corruption and greed at their local levels.  And for the love of all that you may consider holy Trupism is a cult. Not political party, a cult. A cult that America has let get out of hand showing just how broken it is and we are an embarrassment to the world. 

ok.. im done ranting now."
726,726,1623272818,"IMO that's overblown rhetoric.

&gt; China is very clearly aggressive towards both the global world order (South China Sea, UN sanctions, etc) 

UN sanctions? Doesn't China, like the US, have a veto?

China has some valid claims to some of those *uninhabited* islands/shoals based on the fact that Chinese fishermen were building Buddhist shrines there centuries ago before European colonialism took over.

Sure, today China is throwing their weight around, but this is hardly the type of aggression that starts wars or that we commonly think of as territorial ""conquest"" (compare it to the US support of apartheid Israel snuffing out Palestine; or the US illegally occupying 1/3 of Syria -- it's not in the same league).

But to compare Chinese ""aggression"" to the blatant war crimes and ongoing aggression of the US is appalling. There is no doubt who is the biggest war-loving and criminal nation -- it's us!

&gt; China's rise to power on the global stage makes it the largest competitor for influence in the world

For 20 of the past 24 centuries China was the world's richest country. They're a massively large country with the world's largest population. China is simply taking its place at or near the top after the evil British Empire (and later Japan) destroyed China's #1 position.

The US might not like that (we don't), but we have to get over ourselves.

&gt; China engages in blatant intellectual property theft and industrial espionage.

Big deal. There should be no such thing as so-called ""intellectual property"" -- it's a bogus outdated concept that today actually hinders human progress and innovation.

Second, *every* up-and-coming country violates so-called ""intellectual property."" We ripped the British off for *centuries.* In well-documented examples, we blatantly stole British plans for the then-high-tech textile mills and recreated them in the US. Charles Dickens toured the US giving speech after speech railing about American publishers reprinting his books without paying him.

China is doing nothing that we have not done.

But even better, the Chinese are ruled by a communist party and they officially don't believe in so-called ""intellectual property."" We see thing with China's COVID-19 vaccine. They're allowing other countries to manufacture it without royalties (it's a lousy, not-very-effective vaccine, but that's a different story).

&gt; There is China's abysmal human right's record in places like Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Tibet, to name a few.

And much of that is wildly overblown Cold War propaganda. And it also says nothing about the years and years of American blacks protesting against police murders, our gov't being littered with literal *un-prosecuted* torturers and war criminals, or the many blatant human rights abuses one could cite about the US.

We just pretend we're lily-white and pure and that our sh\*t doesn't stink."

735,735,1623107593,"&gt;  I have my doubts that enough of Biden's additional mail-in vote would have turned out to vote physically. 

COVID has a lot of variables and not just the mail-in voting part. Without the pandemic, the public would have had months to dwell on the first impeachment. Reddit got way too hung up on the outcome and not the impact it had on the public. Make no mistake, the impeachment hurt Trump badly. His poll numbers *among Republicans* took the most significant drop of his entire presidency. It was most glaring when people were both asked if he should have been removed but also if he was guilty. 

Plus, mail-in was not universally embraced by rank &amp; file Democrats. I know some people who questioned it and there were clearly people literally scared of death to go to a crowded poll. 

But the biggest problem for Trump or anyone too closely associated at this point is Jan 6th. It was a lose-lose for Republicans &amp; Trump: they gained no supporters because of it and lost perhaps millions from it. Jan 6th has hurt them most with true independent swing voters, who might number roughly 21 million nationwide but can easily decide elections when they are as tight as they have become. Those ""few thousand votes"" you mention are probably lost forever because of the attempt to overthrow the government by the seditious mob. 

7 months ago it was a dead certainty that the GOP would retake the House next year and now there is a path to hold it. Plus, there's a really good chance Joe Manchin will become the loneliest man in the Senate if the Dems increase their majority by one or two seats (he can be kept company by Sinema)."

740,740,1622735248,"Here is the text of the op-ed:

---

If this doesn’t move Sen. Joe Manchin III, then nothing will.

President Biden has sliced hundreds of billions of dollars off his latest infrastructure offer to Republicans, multiple news outlets are reporting. He has offered a $1 trillion package, down from his last offer of $1.7 trillion.

This is plainly intended as a message to the West Virginia Democrat. But the message is larger than it first appears, making the question of whether Manchin will hear it all the more consequential.

The message is that if Republicans reject this, it should be unavoidably clear that Republicans are beyond hope as a governing partner on any terms that Manchin himself would find acceptable. If so, it’s time to move to passage of a bill via the simple majority “reconciliation” process. But that’s not all: If this is so, it’s also time to seriously debate reforming the filibuster.

Biden’s latest offer is a more dramatic move toward Republicans than anything they have offered. The last proposal from Republicans was for $928 billion, but much of that was existing baseline spending. Only $257 billion was new spending.

Worse, the new GOP spending is funded by repurposed covid-19 rescue funds. Other Republicans have suggested a gas tax hike or user fees, which are regressive and nonstarters for Democrats.

Biden’s new offer, meanwhile, is for $1 trillion. Importantly, all that is new money on top of baseline spending, a source familiar with the offer tells me.

Biden’s offer also sticks to his insistence on paying for the plan with corporate tax hikes, according to CNN and Politico. This is good: While Biden is being flexible on spending levels, by drawing a hard line on pay-fors, he’s suggesting he’s prepared to see Democrats act without Republicans — by reconciliation.

That’s where the message to Manchin comes in. Manchin, too, supports paying for infrastructure by raising corporate tax rates, though not as high as Biden wants. And Manchin has flatly rejected GOP pay-fors.

And so, if Biden keeps slashing his plan’s spending levels to win Republicans while keeping the pay-for Manchin wants — and Republicans still don’t budge — at what point does Manchin realize Republicans will never support anything close to what Manchin himself wants?

To be clear, Biden would obviously like it if 10 Senate Republicans did support his new proposal. He could then announce bipartisan support for a targeted infrastructure package — one focused on roads, bridges and broadband — then pursue a second package with other priorities (green technology, caregiving infrastructure, etc.) via reconciliation later.

But plainly, Biden does not expect 10 Republicans to support this offer. The key nuance here is that Manchin wants to persuasively argue — to his constituents and to himself — that a real effort to win them over was made. If this doesn’t do it, what will?

The bigger question is this: How many times must Democrats be led down rabbit holes in search of GOP support that never materializes before Manchin accepts that in a fundamental sense, the bipartisan possibilities he dreams of are simply gone?

### The filibuster favors Republicans

Those who find that prospect terrifying often equate it with the horror of partisan majorities passing things, followed by a switch in power and a partisan swing back the other way. As Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) puts it, the filibuster protects democracy “rather than allowing our country to ricochet wildly every two to four years.”

But that’s absurd: We already live in that country. When Republicans had total control in 2017 and 2018, they didn’t hesitate to use reconciliation to try to jam through Obamacare repeal (they failed) and to pass massive tax cuts for corporations and the rich, both on partisan lines.

Manchin and Sinema want us to believe the filibuster preserves a country in which the parties are incentivized to cooperate on an even policy playing field. But the real question is whether they will consign us to a future in which that playing field is dramatically tilted toward Republican priorities.

This is spelled out in a well-argued piece by Ira Shapiro, a staffer to then-Sen. Robert Byrd of Manchin’s home state. As Shapiro notes, one dirty secret of the filibuster is it creates serious imbalances between things that can pass via reconciliation and things that can’t:

&gt; There is no convincing rationale for establishing two classes of legislative action. It should be unacceptable that the $2.1 trillion tax cut in 2017 or the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act could be done by majority vote (through reconciliation) but that 60 votes are required before helping the Dreamers, requiring background checks for guns, combating climate change or protecting the right to vote.

This privileges the party that cares less about legislating. Because Republicans are most obsessed with cutting taxes, they can carry out their most urgent priority by simple majority, even as many core priorities Democrats want to address require a supermajority.

Perhaps Manchin is content with this situation. If those things could be done by simple majority, he’d be a deciding vote on them, putting him in a tough position. But if so, that rationale has nothing in common with the fantasy rationale filibuster defenders are offering.

If Manchin eventually accepts that Republicans will not be a willing partner on pretty much anything, he’ll have to deal more forthrightly with those basic truths. Until then, Democrats will have to keep sending that message about Republicans in whatever ways are available."

---

You’re driving to an appointment, but you’re running late, and you’re stuck at a red light. Being a law-abiding citizen, you won’t run the light, but you floor the gas pedal the second it changes.

And for a sickening instant — maybe because the pavement is a bit wet — your tires spin uselessly before they gain traction and your car lurches forward.

You say that this has never happened to you? Yeah, right. Anyway, wheelspin is a common phenomenon, and usually harmless. A few minutes after your awkward jack rabbit start you’re driving normally, having mostly forgotten the whole incident.

Which brings me to the current state of the U.S. economy. The business news these days is full of anxiety. Raw material prices are soaring! Businesses can’t find workers! It’s the 1970s all over again!

Chill out, everyone. Mostly we’re just experiencing the economic equivalent of a moment of wheelspin.

OK, there are some real issues involving current events that need discussing — and some of the continuing discussions, shockingly, involve serious debates among serious people. How much are closed schools and lack of child care keeping mothers out of the paid labor force? Are enhanced unemployment benefits making workers reluctant to take low-paying jobs?

And there are genuine questions about where we’ll be next year. Might the economy start to overheat, forcing the Fed to tap on the brakes to head off longer-term inflation? I don’t think that’s the most likely outcome, but it’s certainly a possibility.

Most of the scare headlines right now, however, reflect what you’d expect to see in an economy that’s trying to go from 0 to 60 in seconds flat.

At the beginning of this year, the United States was still very much in the depths of the pandemic. Daily deaths were higher than ever, with Covid-19 taking more than 3,500 lives in the country every day. Parts of the economy that depend on close physical contact were largely frozen: According to the restaurant booking service OpenTable.com, there were about 60 percent fewer seated diners than there had been during the comparable period prepandemic.

Then came an extraordinarily successful vaccination campaign. Deaths have plunged more than 85 percent and are still dropping. As fear recedes, the economy is surging, in what may end up being the fastest recovery ever. For example, restaurant bookings are already almost back to normal.

Why would anyone imagine us able to achieve that kind of sudden acceleration without leaving a few skid marks, and maybe even burning some rubber?

So yes, sawmill operators, who expected a longer slump, got caught short, leading to sky-high lumber prices. Rental car companies, which sold off a large part of their fleets last year, are now scrambling to buy vehicles again, helping to send used-car prices soaring. And so on.

What about those reports of labor shortages? Some of this is what always happens after a period of high unemployment: Businesses grow accustomed to having job applicants lined up at their doors, and get cranky when the buyers’ market ends. Small businesses surveyed in early 2015 reported a severe shortage of qualified workers; strange to say, the employment boom that began in 2010 still had another five years to run.

It is, let’s say, hard to shed tears over employers complaining about potential hires who ask, “How much do you pay?”

Still, there is some real evidence, like the number of job openings, that employers are having trouble hiring workers fast enough to meet soaring demand. And issues like child care are probably playing a role. There may also be a certain amount of “you can take this job and shove it” — some workers, especially those already close to retirement, may just not want to go back to the unpleasant, poorly paid work they had before.

Mainly, however, we’re just seeing the problems you’d expect when the economy tries to roar ahead from a standing start, which means that we’re calling on suppliers to ramp up production incredibly fast and expecting employers to quickly attract a large number of new workers. These problems are real, but they’ll mostly resolve themselves in a few months.

So what do these probably temporary problems say about the longer term, and in particular about President Biden’s economic plans? That’s easy: nothing. Politicians gonna politician, and Biden’s opponents are seizing on every negative bit of news as proof that his entire agenda is doomed. But none of it should be taken seriously.

Yes, labor supply issues may have held back April’s job growth, although more recent data suggest a possible rebound. April inflation surprised on the upside, largely because of used car prices. None of this tells you anything at all about how much we should worry about overheating, let alone how much more we should be spending on infrastructure and family support (answer: a lot) or how we should pay for these initiatives (answer: tax corporations and the rich).

So as I said, chill out. There is some bad news out there, but most of it is a temporary byproduct of extraordinary good news: The virus is losing, and the economy is winning."

Big brotherish?! China's COVID numbers may be cooked but no one is suggesting they're anywhere near 100K dead. We have 5 times that plus. Here our gov't records every phone call we make, the NYT reported that the NSA gives some calls about drugs to local PDs but tells the local police to lie about where they got the info. Still we say we've got a 4th Amendment and China is evil. It's all a matter of perspective.

&gt; The China/Russia relationship isn't an alliance,

We don't know what it is -- that's what frustrates us. It's not like NATO, but Russian and Chinese forces (air, land and sea) routinely do exercises together. 

&gt;  India.

Has no problem with Russia -- they're quite close. India produces advanced Russian tanks and aircraft under license. India and Russia jointly develop advanced missiles together. India does the electronics because they're better at that, Russia does the missile and rocket engines because they're better at that. Their Brahmos jointly-developed anti-ship missile has a longer range, is supersonic and far outclasses anything the US Navy has. (Russia produces even better and smarter anti-ship missiles all by themselves though.)

That relationship goes back decades and decades. India even leases a couple of Russian nuclear attack submarines. That's a level of closeness that very few countries have.

The US dream is to enroll India as an ally and pit it against China and Russia. Indians aren't stupid and they know the US is an imperial country. Indians are very wary of the decades of US support of Pakistan, India's real enemy. India doesn't like China's growing power but the border disputes over worthless land in the Himalayas are just dick measuring contests -- both India and China know that. India will try to use anyone but they'll continue to be independent and nobody's tool.

&gt; While Russia does produce a few products better than the US, 

Today it's entire classes of products. When the Russians demonstrated an electronic warfare system that left one of our advanced Aegis cruisers helpless in the Black Sea as Russian aircraft did repeated runs by the ship that couldn't fight back, the Pentagon immediately pulled multiple aircraft carriers out of action at once for emergency upgrades at Norfolk VA shipyards. We've never done anything like that before simply because 1 nuke could take out a substantial percentage of our fleet.

A few years later when Israel was hitting Syria too hard the Russians in Syria activated a system that blacked out every radar in the northern 1/2 of Israel blind for minutes. The Israelis understood the message and they now only strike Syria in PR stunt strikes.

Russian missile systems are simply way ahead of ours. We can only guess at how effective their anti-aircraft systems are but we know they're generations ahead.

&gt;  Not sure where you're getting your information from, but that's not true.   
&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome#2021

Not from Wikipedia. :-)  And that entry is for the artillery rockets fired from Gaza. Garage made kids toys compared to real missiles.

Again, real life: Syria fired one missile, an SA-5, at Dimona, Israel's main nuclear facility and nuclear bomb making facility. That should be Israel's #1 defended military asset. That one missile got through. The apartheid state came up with some excuses of what happened that the mainstream media parroted, but the reality is the missile got through.

Lebanon's Hezbollah has far more advanced missiles and in quantities that would saturate Israel's Iron Dome even if it works perfectly. In a general Middle East war the Israeli economy will be shut down almost immediately.

&gt; those few products aren't enough for them to win a war.

The Pentagon disagrees. Again, our position in eastern Europe is weak -- period. The US won't do anything to defend Ukraine because we're powerless to do so. Russia could take the 3 Baltic states *easily* anytime they want to, but they don't want to.

While we've been wasting money on special forces Russia has been investing their budgets in real items. Their MIC is far more efficient than our bloated and wasteful MIC.

&gt;  and the rumor is that Russia, China, and the US all have them in development. 

Not true. Russia's hypersonic missiles are not ""in development."" They're tested and are already deployed in increasing quantities on aircraft, ships and ground forces. This means every one of our aircraft carriers can be taken out from a thousand miles away. (Our carriers are pretty useless anyway; right now we only have enough functional F-18s and useless F-35s to equip 1/2 of our carriers. We actually fly the planes around to equip different carriers -- that's how broke and short of equipment we are.)

Our forces are designed for and are great for beating up on defenseless 3rd world countries. But even then we lose those wars. We've lost every war we fought in the 21st century. We're good at destroying things but we never accomplish our political objectives or do anything constructive -- and the world knows this.

In a real war against Russia or China (even 3rd rate Iran!) we will lose a war. That's not my opinion, that's Pentagon war gamers that report that. We just have a mass media that's so uninformative and propagandistic that most people are clueless about the realities.

Again, the WHO -- who has the best data outside of the Chinese gov't -- is not making any claims.

The claims are coming from the US and we have a flat-out Cold War and propaganda war going on with China.

768,768,1621881003,"&gt;We barely shrank, but we shrank. China's economy grew. SK already trades twice as much with China than they do with the US. Korea has a thousand year history of being independent and keeping China at bay, that trade is pushing SK to tamp down the US' hostility towards both NK (SK sees NK as dangerous but a brittle shell of a regime of other Koreans) and China.

China also had the advantage of getting ahead of the curve, being the first one with information regarding the virus and being the first to respond. As well being able to use authoritarian methods to keep people quarantined that you wouldn't see in a democracy, like forcibly removing people from their homes. 

As for the South Korea issue, of course the ROK trades more with China than the US. South Korea is a small sea apart from China, while the United States is an entire ocean away. The world's largest ocean, no less. On top of that, there is also the factor that China produces many finished goods that rely on South Korean products. 

&gt;&gt;I have a feeling Russia intends on developing its strategic alliance with China more and more into the economic realm.

I highly doubt that. The China/Russia relationship isn't an alliance, so much as a fragile friendship borne out of having similar geopolitical rivals. (North America, EU, Japan, India.) 

However, they are also rivals themselves when it comes to vying for influence, especially in an area they both see as ""their own sphere/backyard,"" Central Asia. 

&gt;At this point the Russian benefit of the 2nd gas pipeline to Europe that the US (not Germany) is so hell-bent on stopping is increasingly unimportant to the Russians. 

I don't think it's unimportant to the Russians, either. As it gives them leverage over the EU, especially in the fall and winter months. Not to mention Russia wouldn't want to rely on exports to China, since that would make Russia a junior partner to China. Something Russia does not want to see happen. 

&gt;No one disagrees that China is the #1 trading nation in the world. The IMF has said for years China is the largest economy.

By one metric. They still haven't past the US in another metric. 

&gt;Some Chinese numbers may be cooked, but much of our GDP is useless, non-tradable domestic services whereas China's backbone is manufacturing and building infrastructure way ahead of ours.

Except all major, developed economies always move in the directions of services and high-end manufacturing. Even China is attempting to move in that direction. That's why economists are waiting to see if China, and India for that matter, can successfully avoid the ""middle income trap,"" or if they fall to it. 

&gt;Taking this to a military/geo-political angle, the bottom line is that as the US consolidates moving the NATO front from Germany to the Russian border within artillery range of St. Petersburg, the tiny Russian economy still has a solid manufacturing base, produces better tanks, missiles and EW systems than we do, and Russia would easily defeat NATO in Europe in a war there.

While Russia does produce a few products better than the US, or other NATO countries, those few products aren't enough for them to win a war. And the idea that Russia would win any sort of actual war is laughable. The United States alone would be able to defend Europe from Russia, never mind when you factor in the EU, and likely Canadian militaries, as well as local resistances. 

&gt;The US geo-political position in the world is weak. So weak we publicly and openly talk about going nuclear in a war.

Weaker than it was during the Obama era, perhaps. I would hardly call a country that has close economic ties with it's two bordering neighbors, protected by two oceans, and has a global military presence, coupled with an enormous economy that is capable of producing an abundance of food and also has a global network of alliances is hardly in a weak position. 

&gt;We've seen how useless Israel's anti-missile systems are.

Not sure where you're getting your information from, but that's not true. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome#2021

&gt;During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, approximately 1,800 rockets had been fired at Israel by Hamas from Gaza by 13 May 2021. In the first 24 hours of the conflict 470 rockets were fired, a much higher rate than had been attained in previous conflicts. Of the rockets, 17% were long-range attacks on Tel Aviv, again more than previously.[25] **About 400 of the first 1,600 fell short and landed in Gaza; the Iron Dome system blocked 90% to 95% of the remainder,** according to differing reports by the AP and Israeli armed forces.[112] During the operation Iron Dome shot down a bomb-laden drone.[113]

And no one has anything to defend against hypersonic missiles, and the rumor is that Russia, China, and the US all have them in development. 

Either way, this conversation has veered very far off course. Which was you asking for a source and asking how the Russian economy preformed since COVID. (Poorly.)

May 6, 2021 - The Treasury Department on Wednesday pressed Congress to ramp up efforts to boost or suspend the federal debt limit, warning that the department is uncertain whether it could prevent the federal government from running out of cash. “If Congress has not acted by July 31, Treasury, as it has in the past, may take certain extraordinary measures to continue to finance the government on a temporary basis,” Brian Smith, Treasury’s deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, said. “In light of the substantial Covid-related uncertainty about receipts and outlays in the coming months, it is very difficult to predict how long extraordinary measures might last.” Congress passed a two-year budget deal in 2019 that suspended the legal limit on the debt ceiling until July 31. The agreement was put in place for lawmakers to refer to over budgetary battles and to offer a deeper understanding over spending amid a presidential election year. But a Democrat-controlled Congress must ensure that the Treasury is stable and that the government can continue to fund their big-spending proposals. In the past, when the White House and Congress couldn’t reach a deal over the debt limit, the Treasury had the ability to avert a default on the national debt by reallocating payments and other needs until the suspension or limit increased. These measures could last for months on their own. But with a seething economic crisis jabbing at the nation, the Treasury cautioned that it doesn’t know how long it could maintain its traditional tools for preventing economic calamity..."

It would be wonderful if the Republican Party that Sen. Tim Scott conjured up in his rebuttal speech on Wednesday night actually existed.

In his response to President Biden’s address to Congress, the South Carolina Republican portrayed a party profoundly devoted to racial progress, grounding public health responses in science, spending generously to help Americans through hard times, and making it easier to vote for people of all races.

In so doing, Scott revealed a party badly on the defensive in some of our biggest arguments. Rebuttal speeches are often useless, but this one is instructive: It hints at how the GOP hopes to recapture power despite their defensive posture, with a waiting game.

Biden laid out an expansive vision for transformative government. He renewed his pitch for trillions of dollars in new spending, on everything from infrastructure to a widened social safety net to a dramatically expanded caregiving infrastructure shoring up the human potential of children and families.

This would be partly paid for by tax hikes on corporations, top earners and ultrarich investors, as well as by the recapture of revenue shielded by the accounting trickery of the wealthy and multinational corporations.

In short, Biden is offering a vision of a rebalanced political economy. It would tax back some of the rents that have resulted from badly skewed market rules that have distributed income and wealth upward for decades and channel it into a big boost to the life prospects of those relegated to the bottom and those struggling in the middle.

Scott’s rebuttal is notable for having nothing to say as an answer to this vision of a rebalanced political economy, let alone its underlying assessment of what’s gone wrong.

### Scott’s two-step

Instead, Scott employed a two-step. He portrayed the GOP as favoring government spending amid crisis by citing spending Republicans supported under President Donald Trump, while falling back on bromides about big government to dismiss spending proposed by Biden.

Scott hailed the packages of 2020, including the $2 trillion bill last spring and the $900 billion bill in December. But then he pivoted. The $ 2 trillion covid-19 relief bill that Biden signed was nothing but a “partisan” exercise. Biden’s current proposals are a “liberal wish list” funded by the “biggest tax hikes in a generation.”

This hints at how badly on the defensive Republicans are. Scott needs to portray the GOP as committed to using government to help people, at a time when large majorities favor Biden’s plans.

But this GOP simply doesn’t exist. GOP support for big packages under Trump was just the usual opportunistic Keynesianism, in which Republicans favor stimulus and deficits under GOP presidents and rail at them under Democratic ones.

Republicans won’t entertain any tax hikes at all to pay for their minuscule infrastructure ideas, except for regressive ones on user fees. And they won’t support any of Biden’s plans on caregiving, which Scott dismisses with old slogans about “Washington” controlling your life.

### Nothing to say

Even more tellingly, Scott hailed the wonders of the pre-coronavirus economy. But what about the current economy? The big story of the moment is that the covid-19 crisis has stripped bare stark economic inequities and injustices. We rely heavily on essential workers, yet it can no longer be denied how woefully underpaid and deeply vulnerable many are.

We’ve learned about huge gaps in our caregiving economy and the deep human toll that’s taking. Indeed, as Jordan Weissmann writes, what Biden is really doing now is taking the opportunity created by these revelations to turn the United States into “a normal country for mothers and fathers by providing benefits that much of the developed world already takes for granted.”

But what do Republicans have to say about these newly exposed realities?

Scott’s fallback on decades-old big government bromides suggests Republicans don’t think they need any response to them at all. The GOP portrayed by Scott — one that favors an expansive government role amid crisis — doesn’t really exist. But at a time when Republicans have failed to rally a tea party-type backlash to Biden’s policies, it’s telling he needs to claim it does.

Scott cites various things Republicans support on racial injustice. But then he offers the silly formulation that America is “not a racist country” and trots out the usual vague warnings about responding to racism with reverse racism, an effort to close down discussion of lingering systemic racial inequities.

And Scott hypes the GOP’s great respect for science, but largely while arguing that schools should reopen faster, airbrushing away the party’s support for Trump as he gave the middle finger to science for a year, producing catastrophe.

The speech reads like it was written by strategists who know the GOP is perceived as the party of white grievance, hostility to inclusive democracy, continuing thralldom to the Trumpist refusal to take covid-19 seriously, and absolute opposition to acting amid widespread economic pain, and sought to paper over it all.

What’s the GOP’s answer? To wait. Republicans are betting on the public eventually turning on this spending, helped along by extreme gerrymanders and other anti-majoritarian tactics (dressed up as respect for democracy) as the route back to power.

It could work, of course. But don’t mistake that for a sign of GOP confidence."

On Friday Larry Kudlow, who was Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, told Fox News viewers that Joe Biden’s climate plans would force Americans to stop eating meat. On July 4, he declared, you’d have to “throw back a plant-based beer with your grilled brussels sprouts.”

Kudlow’s remarks raise several questions. What, exactly, does he think beer is made from? Also, doesn’t he know that grilled brussels sprouts are, in fact, delicious?

More important, why would anyone believe this assertion about Biden’s plans, or expect anyone else to believe it? Why were Kudlow’s claims echoed by many Republicans, from Donald Trump Jr., to members of Congress, to the governor of Texas?

To answer this question, it helps to think about Bernie Madoff, the infamous fraudster who died April 14. Seriously.

About Biden and burgers: The administration has, in fact, said nothing at all about changing America’s diet. Furthermore, anything along those lines would be very much at odds with Biden’s whole approach to climate change, which is to rely much more on carrots than on sticks, to provide positive incentives to invest in low-emission technologies rather than discouraging emissions with taxes or regulations.

Whether that approach will prove sufficient is debatable, but it is the approach the administration is taking, and telling people to stop eating meat would be completely out of character.

So where is this coming from? Kudlow took his cues from a sleazy article in The Daily Mail, a right-wing British tabloid. The article didn’t actually assert that Biden is proposing to restrict meat consumption; instead, it offered a series of speculations about what might happen. Among other things it took the most extreme scenario from a University of Michigan study of how reduced meat consumption could affect greenhouse gas emissions — a study released in January 2020 that had nothing whatsoever to do with the Biden plans. The Daily Mail also used a deceptive graphic to make it seem as if this was an actual administration proposal.

American right-wing pundits and politicians then ran with it. Did they actually believe the nonsense they were spouting? Well, Kudlow’s apparent belief that beer is made with meat is arguably a point in his favor, an indication that he’s genuinely clueless rather than merely cynical.

What’s clear, however, is that neither Kudlow nor other Republicans touting an imaginary war on meat saw any need to check out their story, felt any concern that their audience — Fox News viewers, Republican voters — would find the claim that Joe Biden is coming for their red meat implausible.

Why not? That’s where Bernie Madoff comes in.

The revelations about Madoff’s immense Ponzi scheme and how he pulled it off introduced many of us to the concept of affinity fraud: scams that prey upon people by exploiting a sense of shared identity. Madoff defrauded wealthy Jews by convincing them that he was just like them.

A similar approach has long been an essential part of the Republican political strategy. As the party’s economic policies have become ever more elitist, ever more tilted toward the interests of the wealthy, it has sought to cover its tracks by running candidates who seem like regular guys you’d like to have a (meat-based?) beer with.

The flip side of this strategy is a continual attempt by the G.O.P. to convince voters that Democrats, who represent a much more diverse set of voters than Republicans, aren’t people like them; call it disaffinity fraud.

The goal is to portray Democrats as woke feminist vegetarians who don’t share the values of Real Americans. Hence the right’s obsessive focus on “cancel culture” and Democratic women of color, and the continual assertions that the white male senior citizen who leads the party is somehow a passive puppet.

Right-wing media are pushing this narrative nonstop. According to a Morning Consult poll last month, more Republicans said they’d heard “a lot” about the move to withdraw some Dr. Seuss books than said the same about Biden’s huge Covid-19 relief bill.

It doesn’t matter that Joe Biden isn’t actually trying to ban hamburgers or — to take another false claim right-wing pundits and politicians keep repeating — that he hasn’t “taken down” the border with Mexico. Republicans have pretty much given up even trying to make a case against Biden’s actual policies, let alone proposing serious policies themselves.

Instead, it’s all smears. Democrats, declared Kudlow, are “ideological zealots who don’t care one whit about America’s well-being.” That’s pretty rich coming from a man famed for his unwavering commitment to the doctrine that cutting taxes on the wealthy solves all problems, no matter how often his predictions fail.

But never mind; the point is that Kudlow and others consider it OK to throw out wild claims about what Democrats are up to, because those are the kinds of things woke liberals would do, aren’t they?

Will the public go along? The Biden administration thinks not, betting it can overcome the power of affinity fraud with policies that offer real benefits to working Americans. Unfortunately, there’s no guarantee that this strategy will work."
837,837,1619527327,"&gt;President Joe Biden’s first address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday will take place in a U.S. Capitol on high alert, with memories fresh of the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the building by supporters of his predecessor, Donald Trump. The crowd inside the Capitol will be a fraction of the hundreds of members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, top government officials and guests who typically attend, to allow for more social distancing in a COVID-19 pandemic that has killed more than 572,000 Americans. The howl of leaf blowers mingled with the roar of heavy machinery this week around the fenced-in Capitol as ground staff cleared withered leaves and construction crews worked on renovating a fountain at the foot of the complex."

A president holds an authority and can incite immediate action... as we saw with trump, be it when citizens ingested bleach thinking it would protect them from covid, or when his followers stormed the capitol. That alone highlights why former presidents should stay out of politics and also illustrates how not all presidents treat the custom the same. Typically, you more or less see a president disappear from national spotlight  for a few years after they leave office, then slowly come back into political life, but much diminished, occasionally helping out with  campaigns, writing books, etc."

&gt;The Montana Senate voted Thursday to advance a measure banning the use of vaccine passports and prohibiting workplaces from requiring vaccinations as a condition for employment.

&gt;Dozens of supporters of the measure, mostly unmasked, packed the Senate gallery. They erupted into cheers and applause when the Senate voted to advance the measure 30-19, largely along party lines with Republicans in favor.

&gt;The vote came after Benefis Health System, a health care provider in Great Falls, announced earlier this month it would require all its employees to get the COVID-19 vaccine, which has received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration.

&gt;A similar bill failed in the House earlier this year, only to be revived by Republican lawmakers who insist that rules requiring vaccines as a condition for employment or access to services pose a health risk and a threat to religious freedom and privacy.

&gt;“This bill is about us giving people a choice so that they don’t have to be terminated from their employment and so they can maintain their sincerely held personal religious beliefs,” said Sen. Tom McGillvray, the Republican who carried the bill on the Senate floor.

&gt;Opponents of the measure say the bill could negatively impact medically vulnerable residents of nursing homes and assisted care living facilities, where staff would no longer be required to receive vaccines widely believed to be safe, including the annual flu shot."

One, that's off topic. Two, that's already required for most of those things in most places. I'm fine with adding Voter ID laws, as long as it includes automatic voter registration on your 18th birthday, and you can request multiple copies if needed per year, free of charge, with one being automatically sent to you on your 18th birthday free of charge as well. 

It also comes with the compromise that voting needs to be easily accessible, such as mail-in voting and early voting, and there need to be plenty of dropboxes available, as well as plenty of polling places. Unlike in urban Georgia, where the state forces them to wait in line and tries to even make giving water to people waiting illegal. 

&gt;Personally, I don’t trust our government

But you trust them enough to use ""Voter ID"" as a deflection. Got it. 

&gt;or pharmaceutical companies as they have a track record of discriminating against minority groups (our current president included) and only worrying about a bottom line.

So you think corporations are less corrupt? Capitalism is laughing as the wealth gap increases year over year, and the world burns as they try to privatize water. 

&gt;You may like the administration in power now, but I suspect if it we’re Trump, or he runs and wins in 2024 (I really hope not), that the tune would be much different from many.

874,874,1617655164,"Here is the full text of the op-ed:

---

Throughout the 2020 campaign, Joe Biden characterized congressional Republicans as suffering from a kind of delusion brought on by the illness of Donald Trump; once he departed, they’d come back to their senses and find ways to work with him.

While many people derided this idea as naïve, Biden stuck with it. Once Trump is defeated, Biden said in May 2019, “you will see an epiphany occur among many of my Republican friends."" The next month, he said: “With Trump gone, you’re going to begin to see things change.""

Even with the election behind him and Republicans supporting Trump’s lie that the election was stolen, Biden kept it up, predicting in December 2020 that “I may have to eat these words,” but once ""Trump’s shadow fades away, you’re going to see an awful lot change.”

How do those words taste now?

Biden was mostly expressing hope — and saying the kind of thing a lot of people would like to be true. (He also predicted just before the 2012 election that if he and Barack Obama won, that the GOP “fever will have broken."") But what we see now is that this “fever” was only partly about Trump or those Republican officeholders.

Instead, the politicians and their voters are trapped in a seemingly unbreakable, mutually reinforcing cycle of not just partisanship but outright delusion, one that makes cooperation with Democrats all but impossible.

&gt; Three months after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol to try to overturn his November election loss, about half of Republicans believe the siege was largely a non-violent protest or was the handiwork of left-wing activists “trying to make Trump look bad,” a new Reuters/Ipsos poll has found.

If you were an average Republican and you wanted to believe the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, it wouldn’t be all that hard to convince yourself. You’d have lots of conservative media stars telling you it’s what happened, while lots of your party’s politicians alleged widespread fraud.

The very complexity of the American election system would help, too. An election involves so many agencies and people in so many places that you could imagine nefarious goings-on happening somewhere.

But now imagine you wanted to believe something else: That the Capitol was not attacked on Jan. 6 by violent Trump supporters, but instead it was actually a “false flag” operation organized by leftists. That would be harder, since it was a specific incident, we’ve seen all the video and the arrests of people deep inside far-right movements, and there is not a single iota of evidence that it was actually antifa or the Symbionese Liberation Army or anyone other than the obvious culprits.

And yet that’s what so many Republicans believe.

They believe this even though only a few Republican officeholders have gone so far as to claim that’s what happened. Unlike with the election lie, you don’t have dozens upon dozens of prominent Republicans claiming it was a false flag operation.

But every Republican understands the radical delusions of their constituents. And even in cases where they know perfectly well that a good portion of their supporters have pretty much lost their minds, the numbers of those supporters are too big to ignore. So they indulge them or change the subject — while filing those opinions away for future reference.

Then when it comes time to consider other issues, it becomes part of the calculation. If you’re a Republican officeholder, you know that your supporters are deep into this kind of conspiratorial thinking, and you’ve probably responded to your base’s radicalization by feeding them a diet of culture-war nonsense, from Mr. Potato Head to Dr. Seuss, to show them that you despise the libs as much as they do.

Which of course has made them hate the idea of you working with Democrats even more — they want their representatives to fight! So you keep looking for ways to show them that’s just what you’ll do, which conditions them to keep wanting it.

This cycle no longer needs Trump himself to keep it turning.

Then when some legislation is in the offing that in theory could be bipartisan — a covid relief bill or an infrastructure bill — whatever the Republican politician’s substantive beliefs about it, they know they won’t be rewarded for voting with members of the other party. Everyone may claim bipartisanship is worthwhile, but when they actually have a chance to engage in it, the risks look too great.

To be clear, the Democratic electorate doesn’t much desire for bipartisanship either, particularly if it comes at the expense of substantive things they want Congress to achieve. But there’s less of a Democratic market for performative bashing of the other side. It isn’t that there’s no market for it all among Democrats, but it’s smaller; just see which Democrat they elected president.

Biden may get half of his wish: Trump is already fading, and we don’t yet know how much influence he’ll retain in the GOP. But either way, there will be no epiphanies."
875,875,1617652254,"I see their point. The center-right Biden has many conservative leanings.

His current COVID-related spending and infrastructure spending is just common sense. Since traitor Trump claimed he wanted to spend money on infrastructure that ""difference"" is negated.

Both of our capitalist ruling parties vehemently oppose Medicare-For-All, paid vacations, basic income guarantees, tying the minimum wage to the rate of inflation -- and a whole host of social benefits that other advanced countries take as ""normal.""

So what are the actual differences between the pro-business Republican Party and the pro-business Democrat Party?

The Democrats support more liberal social positions and deficit spending for social programs, whereas the Republicans are more white-oriented and only support deficit spending when it's for tax cuts for the rich and corporations and Pentagon spending.

Why wouldn't the US support HK protesters? And it's not ""our war,"" in Syria. It's a civil war, and different countries just happened to choose different sides to support. It's not like that's the first time that has happened in history.

&gt;However, there are already statutes at the federal level that require people to be vaccinated against various infectious diseases in some cases. Under current federal law, for example, “a foreign national who applies for an immigrant visa abroad, or who seeks to adjust status to a permanent resident while in the United States,” must show proof of vaccination for mumps, measles, rubella, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, haemophilus influenzae type B and hepatitis B.

But often, the multiple diffuse centers of power in the US political system -- federal, state and local -- appear to have exacerbated the task of marshaling an effective national response to the crisis -- especially in terms of Covid-19 testing or the provision of protective gear for hospital workers. In avenues of inquiry that might be relevant to the current crisis, it exposed a lack of Washington preparedness for the disaster and considered the balance between civil liberties and government-ordered security measures and how poor coordination inside government led to tragedy."

Most people have just been accumulating money in their bank accounts but very little spending it because the country hasn't come out of lockdown. When people start spending more money (i.e., velocity picks up), as they tend to do over the spring and summer, it has a tendency to drives prices up. This effect is amplified if you have a fundamental supply and demand problem. This occurred during the early 1970s when OPEC cut off oil flow to North America because we supported Israel. 

Why is this relevant to today? Well, when COVID hit the economy last year and everyone stopped driving, oil prices plunged. The oil companies stopped drilling because the prices went to shit, and no bank was going to lend them money to drill (what bank in 2020 would lend an \*oil company\* money?). So now, we have a very limited supply of oil, with no reinvestment in drilling, and increasing demand because everyone's going to want to travel again as lockdowns ease off and the weather becomes nicer. This is pretty much happening around the world, which doesn't help things.

1. The disease disproportionately affects black, brown, and poor people; both groups under constant assault by republicans.

2. It has a higher rate of mortality among older people, who presently live longer during a time of decreasing birth rate, thereby leading to entitlement strain and inverted population structures. Both relate to economic issues republicans ramble and rant about endlessly.  

3. The pandemic forces people to be more socially distant, therefore less promiscuous.  It creates a vacuum of social interaction, thereby increasing silent demand for and value of face-to-face socialization.  These are all positives from a religious conservative perspective.  

4. Employment hardship amid a thriving stock market has proven that the economies of the classes are segregated, with all benefit flowing to one side.  Both sides of the American political clusterfuck hold this as evidence supporting their world views, but in the case of republicans it’s an effect to be preserved and encouraged.

5. The virus spreads faster and has a higher body count in cities, which tend to be left-leaning.  Rural communities are already more spaced, distanced, and isolated, therefore the republican base is protected against the worst effects when it comes to electorate reduction.

COVID is fighting their methy teahadist civil war for them.  Of course they won’t get immunized, and they’ll try to prevent their employees from doing it too.  The orange dick encouraged and exacerbated the spread of the virus for a reason.

But the one thing I wonder about is that it substitutes an interpreted number for an actual number.  That is, we know in the case of the US and the UK what the actual corona virus deaths are.  (Ignoring the reporting questions because we have to.)

This model assumes that numbers over the ""expected"" deaths are attributable to covid.  They may be - or I could be misinterpreting them - but I would rather use actuals when they are available."
921,921,1616094005,"It's easy to be misled when looking at matters such as this. I'll explain below. Meanwhile, with some difficulty, I have found what I was looking for. The [Centre for Evidence Based Medicine](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/excess-mortality-across-countries-in-2020/) has a table presenting age standardized mortality, total excess mortality and the difference for the year 2020 including the percentage increase or decrease.  These are presented as deaths/100,000 which, of course, *takes population numbers into account*. Their table, unfortunately, only covers *some* countries. 

Here are a few numbers. ED = expected deaths. AD = actual deaths, EX = excess and CH = change:

USA ED 1020 | AD 1152 | EX 132 | CH +12.9%


England and Wales ED 960 | AD 1060 | EX 100 | CH +10.5%


Scotland 1134 | AD 1219 | EX 85 | CH +7;5


Canada ED 708 | AD 751 | EX 42 | CH +6.0


Germany ED 1016 | AD 1049 | EX 33 | CH +3.3%


France ED 839 | AD 895 | EX 56 | CH +6.7%

Yah Scotland.

See the table for other countries. The USA is tied for second worst country on a per capita basis with Spain. Poland is the worst - 175/100,000, 14.4%. There are actually a few countries (Iceland, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Latvia, South Korea) that had *fewer* deaths in 2020 than in 2019.

Leaving aside different total population numbers from different sources (a very minor problem) the error is most likely due to taking a mortality number that was released earlier than Dec 31, 2020. I've met this problem before when looking at the CDC site. During 2020 there were at least two reports - and probably others - released in October 2020 and mid-December 2020. The CDC has yet to release its final 2020 tally. This is common practice. Crunching the numbers has more complications than most of us know about. 

So, rest easy. The USA is, indeed, in worse shape than the UK, far worse if you look at Scotland. My own interest was piqued by the numbers from Sweden compared to all the surrounding Nordic countries. I think this is pretty good evidence that Sweden's early approach was wrongheaded.

[Lets.](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/10/politics/whats-in-the-covid-relief-bill/index.html)

* Stimulus checks

* Unemployment assistance

* Aid to states and municipalities

* Nutrition assistance

* Housing aid

* Tax credits for families and workers

* Optional paid sick and family leave

* Education and child care

* Health insurance subsidies and Medicaid

* More money for small businesses

* Vaccines and testing

* Rural hospital assistance

That all looks great to me. What don't you like?

&gt; Trump wanted 2000 for everyone NOT Biden. Dems literally kept us all from receiving stimulus during a time we all needed it, causing people to struggle and hurt more.

Do you not understand how the US government works?

You see the Democrats in the House voted for Trump's $2000 stimulus. [Even just for just the $2k checks, basically all the Democrats in the house voted for it. Most Republicans voted against it.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/28/house-votes-on-2000-stimulus-checks-after-trump-signs-relief-bill.html)

The reason you never got $2,000 was the GOP.

&gt; Arguably to make people more desperate and believe Biden is a savior, just like OP is. Biden has lied about everything in his campaign.

For some this is seen as progress in the fight against COVID-19. But the vaccine has stirred controversy with some Catholics, not on the goal of protecting people, but on how the vaccine is made.

The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines use fetal cell lines, which are fetal cells that were obtained during elective abortions from decades ago, not recent abortions. The fetal cells are not injected into a patient, but rather are used in a lab setting to create the virus itself.

“We use the fetal cells in the laboratory to grow the virus, the virus is pulled out of the cells and then used to make the vaccine. so people can rest assure that there are no fetal cells in the vaccine, just the virus that was grown in that medium,” said Kylie Hall, a project coordinator with North Dakota State University’s Center for Immunization Research and Education.

Using fetal cell lines is not a new science and is used in other vaccines such as Hepatitis A, rubella, and rabies, dating back to the 1960s and 1970s."

Quite true. That's why he was installed in the White House. Trump ruled not with a ""mandate"" from the people, but by the power of the gov't.

It shows that the American people disapproved of traitor Trump as president. He had no ""mandate"" -- he was an anomaly that our outdated Constitution saddled us with.

&gt; His son belongs in prison. He does too.

Well, then traitor Trump should have had the Justice Dept. indict the Bidens -- so why didn't they?! Based on my reading, the DOJ didn't indict the Bidens because there was not enough evidence.

I've got no problem investigating the Bidens. I'm saddened that traitor Trump did not fulfill his promise to lock up Hillary Clinton -- clearly she was guilty of crimes.

976,976,1614614544,I said the debt grew at basically the same rate before covid-19. I am as unhappy about the debt growing as anyone else and I never said that the Republican weren't at fault for the normal growth rate of the debt. Which is said to consider that being normal.
977,977,1614613842,"The debt only started growing after covid was declared a pandemic that's when the debt spiked otherwise it was growing at the same as Obama era debt. The issue was we didn't have enough money for that emergency and spent like 3 trillion dollars. 

I wouldn't say the Republicans themselves were at fault the fact that Trump lowered the corporate tax so much was a little crazy his trade wars, which against china were probably a good idea, caused farmers to take in money from the tarrifs sucks, but the pandemic and how it was handled really messed it up. I hope Biden can lower the debt."
978,978,1614516012,"Its because too many items were suggested under ""covid relief "" that had nothing to do with it"
979,979,1614490403,"&gt;We just went through the most tumultuous one term presidency in our history largely because working class people have been neglected.

Well, I do not think that this is true.  Whatever was happening during the Trump presidency did not have much to do with working people.  Yes, these did not profit from its policies, but they were not the ""center of attention"".   There were a lot of other issues that pushed voters to reject Trump.

Having said that, small businesses are a powerful block both in the Republican and the Democratic party.  If a good number of them believe that they cannot simply make it with such a hike in the minimum wage, well, you will have this reflected in the Congress.

In any case, many states have already increased their minimum wage, so this is not something that applies throughout the country.  I think that if the covid-based recession recedes and there is a wave of prosperity, this bill may be introduced again."

989,989,1614116337,"Flu-related deaths are normally 12,000 to 70,000. So that accounts for about a tenth of all the covid19 deaths. Net deaths are not the same, that's a lie, there are hundreds of thousands of excess deaths. It's more likely that there are more covid19 deaths than recorded.

Look, my daughter and her boyfriend are both Pulmonary and Critical Care docs, they are the ones who see this first hand, and their friends and colleagues are the ones who see this first hand. Nobody is lying, nobody is padding the numbers.

Coroners and others who record the ultimate cause of death are not lying or padding, they have no reason to do that. The attending physician notes the putative cause of death, then it takes 1 to 4 weeks for the ultimate cause of death to be determined and recorded. The coroner doesn't just say ""covid"" if the primary cause of death was an automobile accident or old age. My uncle died of covid, he was old, but he might have lived another 10 years if he'd been better about wearing a mask, but you know those Trumpers.

Flu deaths are down for a number of reasons. People wearing masks, not as many people congregating indoors, not as many people congregating in any way. There have also been changes at the source of most flu mutations, which is East Asia. They've stepped up their mask wearing, changed some of their animal husbandry practices, and also practiced more social distancing. All of these changes combined add up to major difficulties for a virus trying to spread.

&gt; Deaths in Mexico last year were **52 per cent higher than in previous years**, putting the rate of excess deaths during the coronavirus pandemic well above that in some countries seen as suffering the worst outbreaks in the world, including the US, UK and Brazil.

&gt; New official data showed Mexico has registered 977,081 deaths since March 2020, compared with an expected 641,556 for the same period based on the 2015-19 death tolls. Since the start of the epidemic, Mexico has officially confirmed more than 2m cases and almost 180,000 deaths from Covid-19.

So, again, fuck you and the horse you rode in on."
990,990,1614106908,That’s middle school logic. To even compare nations in this way is stupid. You can’t compare Sweden to the US.   In Sweden many people live alone. Some nations have multigenerational households. The age demographics plays a big part in the death count. Also the protocols to determine a Covid death are different between nations. So to just take the total number of Covid deaths in the world and multiplying it by the percent population of that nation to the world to get what each nations death count should be is extremely asinine. No wonder this is an echochamber.
991,991,1614104029,I have so many dumb replies to respond to I don’t know where to start. Damn you people are brainwashed. First of all he said his administration didn’t inherent a vaccine. That’s 1. Secondly on Jan 20 the US administered more than a million vaccines that day. So this 100 days 100 million vaccines is a total joke. It should be twice that at least. There’s no stimulus check which was promised to happen almost within the first two weeks. Hasn’t happened yet. He mandated mask on all federal land and then was maskless walking on the Lincoln memorial. Also hospitals were incentivized to mark deaths as Covid deaths even it was a person in their 90s with a terminal cancer. The test have a 20% false positive rating and are way oversenstive. A person swabbed a peach and it came back positive. More people died in 2019 than in 2020. Clearly many of these covid deaths are just normal deaths. I bet most of you haven’t even went on to the CDC to look at the chart for Covid death by age.
992,992,1614103835,"I think our numbers are grossly overrepresented. R/conspiracy brought up a lot of good points like how the number of flu related deaths dropped significantly over 2020, and net deaths is about the same as 2019 (though that can be explained at least partially by fewer accidents, less fast food, less spread of other diseases, and cities catching up on pest control on a scale they couldn't do before)

People who are COVID positive, but died from non-COVID related illnesses or injuries are put down as COD: COVID. Now, some of those like COPD it makes sense for. COPD would have killed eventually and also likely the reason COVID killed them. But people dying in a car accident? That shouldn't count as a COVID death. On the flip side, some of those nursing home patients had old age put down after dying of COVID. 

Go further into how hospitals got paid more for COVID patients, there is rumors of COVID fraudulently being added to records to get more money. People reported getting a positive result without ever taking a test. I haven't seen any completed investigations yet though.

I don't think we will ever know the real numbers, but I still think we'd be top 3 minimum."
993,993,1614103661,"&gt;  Is Cuomo at fault for sending positive Covid homecare residents back to their living facilities? 

Yes, he is. So, next question?

The issue is that Biden's policies have not yet had the time to produce results, beyond a bit more awareness and a ramping up of vaccinations. These will take more time to show an impact."
994,994,1614103064,Is trump at fault for the 500k covid deaths?
995,995,1614102321,"The US has 4.2% of global population, so we should have 105,000 deaths. Trump's lying and incompetence led to 400,000 extra deaths. Biden hasn't lied about Covid, nor been incompetent in his response, so he's not responsible for any extra deaths."
996,996,1614101281,Is each governor responsible for each citizen in their own state? The ones that have died? Or do we pick and chose who to blame and who not to blame? Is Cuomo at fault for sending positive Covid homecare residents back to their living facilities? Where they infected even more high risk people to Covid?
997,997,1614090935,"Masks alone caused all of those deaths, huh? 

What about the [european cdc](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-face-masks-community-first-update.pdf) who said, just last week, ""The evidence regarding the effectiveness of medical face masks for the prevention of COVID-19 in the 
community is compatible with a small to moderate protective effect, but there are still significant
uncertainties about the size of this effect. Evidence for the effectiveness of non-medical face masks, face shields/visors and respirators in the community is scarce and of very low certainty.""

Maybe we have the most deaths because 70% of the country is overweight, many many people have diabetes, and heart disease is the #1 cause of death (heart disease caused by obesity and high sodium diets). All of those comorbidities, those don't count?"

A polished tray with chilled bottles and highball glasses was already prepared for either response. Directions for pouring the soda were detailed in a process no fewer than seven steps long—and illustrated with four photo exhibits.

1009,1009,1613527480,My families experience with Covid. [https://youtu.be/kAx09nqjHGU](https://youtu.be/kAx09nqjHGU)
1010,1010,1613413104,"Now that the vast majority of Senate Republicans voted to acquit former president Donald Trump of inciting violent insurrection, as we all knew they would, Democrats should immediately respond as follows:

1. Pass H.R.1 and S.1 with all deliberate speed.

2. Be prepared to nuke the legislative filibuster if and when Republicans obstruct it in the Senate.

3. Get the package into law as quickly as possible.

Those are the House and Senate bills that would expand voting rights, make voting easier in numerous ways and place limits on counter-majoritarian tactics such as voter suppression and gerrymandering, which Republicans are cheerfully escalating in numerous states.

Here’s what the moment requires, above all: Democrats must accept the full implications of the GOP’s ongoing and intensifying radicalization. And they must be prepared to act upon them.

We just saw all but seven Senate Republicans acquit Trump after he waged an unprecedented effort to overturn U.S. democracy that included incitement of mob violence to disrupt the constitutional processes governing how we conclude our elections. That’s more Republicans voting to convict than expected, but it’s still a dark outcome — and an ominous one.

What’s more, that came after Trump spent months trying to subvert the results through all manner of corrupt means, including egging on the terrorizing of vote counters and bullying election officials to manufacture votes to overturn certified results.

Much of the GOP went all in with many of those efforts. Large swaths of the party supported an effort to cancel millions of votes in four states based on fictions, and even voted to invalidate President Biden’s electors in Congress — after the assault on the Capitol.

Even relatively “responsible” Republicans displayed this ongoing radicalization. GOP congressional leaders — such as Sen. Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Rep. Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) — refused to recognize Biden’s win for weeks. Then, after mouthing noises of disapproval about Trump’s election lies, they meekly backed off, all to keep Trump voters in the GOP coalition.

Trump’s acquittal only confirms what many observers had long pointed out: In some fundamental sense, much of the GOP is no longer functioning as an actor in a democracy. Norm Ornstein and Thomas Mann called this way back in 2012:

&gt; The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics. It is ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.

Ornstein and Mann couldn’t possibly have realized how prescient this would prove. Consider the larger story arc of the past year: A spectacularly malevolent botching of a pandemic; a horrific economic collapse; and, now, a months-long effort to subvert the verdict of the majority of Americans who chose a new direction of robust government action to deal with these challenges, which Trump, backed by Republicans, did so much to inflict upon us.

We’re now looking at a GOP that is simply not part of the conversation about how to address two of our country’s biggest crises of the modern era. And, even as the party will opt for this path, Republicans are in a position to recapture the House in two years largely via extreme gerrymanders, as they themselves have boasted.

In short, the Republican Party will do all it can to grind the Biden agenda to a halt, crippling our ability to act in the face of these major crises, not to mention other longer-term ones, such as stagnant wages, skyrocketing inequality and our warming planet.

And then, to remain competitive in national elections, Republicans will redouble their commitment to making it harder to vote and to rigging electoral maps to maximize their share of power relative to the proportion of actual votes they win.

This means Democrats must be willing to exercise power while they have it to go big on covid relief and the economy — and mercifully, they don’t appear to be chasing bipartisan support for its own sake. But it also means being willing to deploy power to prevent a quick return to national power for Republicans via minority rule, and the dysfunction, disillusionment and resurgence of authoritarianism that this would bring.

Democrats have a responsibility to do all they can to avoid consigning the country to that fate.

One might think this means a future in which each party goes all out to do what it can on its own while in power, followed by sinking back into brutal guerrilla resistance when they lose it.

But that future is already upon us. That was made clear by the GOP’s 2017 headlong rush into a purely partisan effort to throw 20 million people off health insurance and pass massively regressive tax cuts for the rich, busting the deficit and constraining possibilities for future government action.

For Democrats to act boldly out of a forthright appreciation of these circumstances does not rule out all bipartisan cooperation. One can see Democrats working with a handful of GOP senators on things such as an expanded child tax credit or infrastructure repair. But it does mean accepting the need to act forcefully to neutralize the GOP’s reliance on anti-democratic tactics, which will only get worse.

As dark as Trump’s acquittal might feel, this moment still offers real prospects for civic renewal. The decisive majority defeat of Trump and his movement in an extraordinarily high turnout election was a real success, particularly in that it was so heavily driven by intense civic engagement.

It’s also inspiring that the election went relatively smoothly, due to the heroic diligence of countless election workers across the country — including many Republicans who bucked their party’s lurch into authoritarianism — amid brutal and unpredictable pandemic conditions and a hyper-charged atmosphere of violent civil conflict.

But Trump’s acquittal by so many Republicans after an unprecedented effort to overthrow U.S. democracy also hints at the fragility of those gains. Fully realizing the potential of civic renewal embedded in this moment will require Democrats to accept the full implications of this ongoing radicalization — and to act upon them."

Trump lives in lefty minds rent-free, and will forever.

Trump's ""accomplishments"" were simply in using the power of the imperial presidency -- changing regulations, enacting easily-overturned presidential directives, things like that. Biden should *easily* be able to reverse all of traitor Trump's ""accomplishments.""

1022,1022,1612908265,"If you have trouble with the paywall, here's the text of the op-ed:

---

A dozen years ago, just before Barack Obama was sworn in as president amid the Great Recession, I wrote a disconsolate column titled “The Obama Gap.” At a time when many viewed the president-elect as a transformational figure, I lamented the caution of his economic policy. His proposed stimulus, I argued, would fall well short of what was needed.

Sadly, I was right. And as I also warned at the time, Obama didn’t get a second chance; the perceived failure of his economic policy, which mitigated the slump but didn’t decisively end it, closed off the possibility of further major action.

The good news — and it’s really, really good news — is that Democrats seem to have learned their lesson. Joe Biden may not look like the second coming of F.D.R.; Chuck Schumer, presiding over a razor-thin majority in the Senate, looks even less like a transformational figure; yet all indications are that together they’re about to push through an economic rescue plan that, unlike the Obama stimulus, truly rises to the occasion.

In fact, the plan is aggressive enough that some Democratic-leaning economists worry that it will be too big, risking inflation. However, I’ve argued at length that they’re wrong — or, more precisely, that, as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says, the risks of doing too little outweigh any risk of overheating the economy. In fact, a plan that wasn’t big enough to raise some concerns about overheating would have been too small.

But how did Democrats get so bold? The answer is that they’ve learned some important things about both economics and politics since 2009.

On the economic side, Democrats have finally stopped believing in the debt boogeyman and the confidence fairy, who will make everything better if you slash spending.

There was a time when many Democrats — including President Obama — accepted the proposition that public debt was a huge problem. They even took seriously warnings from people like Representative Paul Ryan that debt was an “existential threat.” But predictions of an imminent fiscal catastrophe kept being proved wrong, and at this point mainstream economists have become much more relaxed about debt than they were in the past.

Some Democrats also used to worry that big spending programs would hurt the economy by undermining business and investor confidence, and conversely that caution would be rewarded with higher private investment. But this doctrine has also been belied by experience; austerity doesn’t instill confidence, it just imposes pain.

But if Democrats have learned a lot about economic reality since 2009, they’ve learned more about political reality.

Obama came into office sincerely believing that he could reach across the aisle, that Republicans would help him deal with the economic crisis. Despite the reality of scorched-earth opposition, he continued to seek a “grand bargain” on debt. He regarded the rise of the Tea Party as a “fever” that would break in his second term. He was, in short, deeply naïve.

Many progressives worried that President Biden, who had served in the Senate in a less polarized era, who talks a lot about unity, would repeat Obama’s mistakes. But so far he and his congressional allies seem ready to go big, even if that means doing without Republican votes.

One thing that may be encouraging Democrats, by the way, is the fact that Biden’s policies actually are unifying, if you look at public opinion rather than the actions of politicians. Biden’s Covid-19 relief plan commands overwhelming public approval — far higher than approval for Obama’s 2009 stimulus. If, as seems likely, not a single Republican in Congress votes for the plan, that’s evidence of G.O.P. extremism, not failure on Biden’s part to reach out.

Beyond that, Biden and company appear to have learned that caution coming out of the gate doesn’t store up political capital to do more things later. Instead, an administration that fails to deliver tangible benefits to voters in its first few months has squandered its advantage and won’t get a do-over. Going big on Covid relief now offers the best hope of taking on infrastructure, climate change and more later.

Oh, and Democrats finally seem to have learned that voters aren’t interested in process. Very few Americans know that the Trump tax cut was rammed through on a party-line vote using reconciliation, the same maneuver Democrats are now pursuing, and almost nobody cares.

Finally, I suspect that Democrats realize that getting policy right is even more important in 2021 than it was in 2009 — and not just because of the economics. When much of the opposition party won’t acknowledge election results, condones insurrection and welcomes conspiracy theorists into its ranks, you really don’t want to pursue policies that might fall short and thereby empower that party in the years ahead.

Put it this way: Debt isn’t and never was an existential threat to our nation’s future. The real existential threat is an illiberal G.O.P. that looks more like Europe’s far-right extremists than a normal political party. Weakening policy in ways that might help that party’s prospects is a terrible idea — and I think Democrats realize that.

So this time Democrats are ready to seize the day. Let’s hope it will be enough."

I know hating people who have stuff is a whole political identity, but letting socioty progress without statist interference works out for the best as proven by the pre covid economy.

As for democrats policy accomplishments, they're bragging about printing so much money even when the unemployment rate is back down to 7%, they're going to drive the us dollar to hyperinflation all while singing that they're the saviors of the proletariat, you call it an accomplishment because the side effects haven't kicked in yet."
1026,1026,1612811061,"Thankfully Democrats are capable of policy accomplishments while also pursuing other policies, like holding a President accountable. 

Unlike Republicans, who can only do things like pass a tax break for the wealthy and well-off, and then completely ignore a global pandemic that results in hundreds of thousands of dead Americans from their neglect. 

If people were tired of it, the Democrats wouldn't have won the House, Senate, and White House by record voter turnout.

What policy accomplishments do you want seen done?

1036,1036,1612463363,"If you have trouble with the paywall, here's the text of the op-ed:

---

It’s looking more and more like Democrats’ covid-19 relief bill is going to pass — and it will have to pass without any Republican help. While some advocates of “bipartisanship” might consider that a problem, it’s better seen as good news, proof of how broken the process of legislation has become and how it absolutely must change — and right away.

Both houses of Congress have now passed resolutions — on purely party-line votes — that begin the process toward passing the final bill through the Senate under reconciliation rules. That will allow it to succeed with a majority of votes and not the supermajority required to defeat a Republican filibuster.

While a group of Republican senators recently went to the White House to present President Biden with a covid relief counterproposal, no one seriously thinks more than one or two of them — if any — will wind up voting for the bill. So Democrats have no choice but to proceed with reconciliation.

Nevertheless, Democrats responded to the Republican suggestion by paring down their proposal for $1,400 stimulus checks, lowering the income limit from $75,000 for an individual and $150,000 for a couple to $50,000 and $100,000 respectively.

The White House now argues that the bill is “bipartisan,” because even though it will get complete opposition from congressional Republicans, lots of Republican voters support it. You could call that just clever rhetoric, but it happens to be true. A new Quinnipiac poll finds that 68 percent of Americans support the relief bill as a whole, and 78 percent support sending $1,400 checks. The latter number includes 64 percent of Republicans, and 37 percent of them said they support the relief bill even though it was presented to them as Biden’s doing.

That’s an important thing for Democrats to appreciate: Even on a hugely popular bill that addresses an urgent crisis, absolutely no Republican cooperation will be forthcoming. After this experience, not even the most nostalgic advocate of bipartisanship could convince themselves that the right amount of compromise or cajoling will secure a bipartisan solution to any of the other many challenges the country faces.

If Republicans won’t join with Democrats on covid relief, do you think they will on health care or climate change or workers’ rights or child care or anything else? Of course they won’t.

In fairness, that’s not only because Republicans want Biden to fail, though they do. They also believe that there’s something grubby and unfair about government doing too much to serve the public; when Democrats get elected, Republicans often complain that they bribed greedy voters with “free stuff.” (The argument does not apply to the wealthy; Republicans believe they respond to government largesse by becoming even more nobly industrious.)

It’s theoretically possible that at some point Republicans will have a change of heart and support the relief bill even if they object to some parts of it. But no one actually believes that’s going to happen. More likely is that they’ll be united in their opposition and some of the things Democrats want to include — such as an increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour — will be taken out to satisfy conservative Democrats.

Once that happens and the bill passes by reconciliation, every Senate Democrat will have to take stock of what lessons it holds for the remainder of this Congress.

The primary lesson ought to be this: The Senate under its current rules has become nothing less than the enemy of the American people, and those rules have to change.

As long as the filibuster remains and one party refuses to pass any significant legislation — as Republicans are about to prove they will — only one major bill per year can pass. Reconciliation rules also forbid the inclusion of any provision that isn’t directly about the budget, excluding enormous areas of policy and public need.

That is simply incompatible with governing.

You could indulge senators such as Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) who have an irrational attachment to the filibuster by reforming it but not eliminating it. There are many ways one could do so, including forcing the minority party to mount old-fashioned talking filibusters, changing the vote threshold to overcome them or expanding the exceptions to the rule, in effect creating additional reconciliation-like opportunities to pass important bills on a majority vote.

Each approach has its pros and cons. But the fate of this covid relief bill will show us that Senate Democrats have no choice but to start debating them and pick the one they decide is best.

So 10 Republican senators are proposing an economic package that is supposed to be an alternative to President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. The proposal is only a third of the size of Biden’s plan and would in important ways cut the heart out of economic relief.

Republicans, however, want Biden to give in to their wishes in the name of bipartisanship. Should he?

No, no, 1.9 trillion times, no.

It’s not just that the G.O.P. proposal is grotesquely inadequate for a nation still ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. Beyond that, by their behavior — not just over the past few months but going back a dozen years — Republicans have forfeited any right to play the bipartisanship card, or even to be afforded any presumption of good faith.

Let’s start with the substance.

By any measure, January was the worst pandemic month so far. More than 95,000 Americans died of Covid-19; hospitalizations remain far higher than they were at previous peaks.

True, the end of the nightmare is finally in sight. If all goes well, at some point this year enough people will have been vaccinated that we’ll reach herd immunity, the pandemic will fade away and normal life can resume. But that’s unlikely to happen before late summer or early fall.

And in the meantime we’re going to have to remain on partial lockdown. It would, for example, be folly to reopen full-scale indoor dining. And the continuing lockdown will impose a lot of financial hardship. Unemployment will remain very high; millions of businesses will struggle to stay afloat; state and local governments, which aren’t allowed to run deficits, will be in dire fiscal straits.

What we need, then, is disaster relief to get afflicted Americans through the harsh months ahead. And that’s what the Biden plan would do.

Republicans, however, want to rip the guts out of this plan. They are seeking to reduce extra aid to the unemployed and, more important, cut that aid off in June — long before we can possibly get back to full employment. They want to eliminate hundreds of billions in aid to state and local governments. They want to eliminate aid for children. And so on.

This isn’t an offer of compromise; it’s a demand for near-total surrender. And the consequences would be devastating if Democrats were to give in.

But what about bipartisanship? As Biden might say, “C’mon, man.”

First of all, a party doesn’t get to demand bipartisanship when many of its representatives still won’t acknowledge that Biden won legitimately, and even those who eventually acknowledged the Biden victory spent weeks humoring baseless claims of a stolen election.

Complaints that it would be “divisive” for Democrats to pass a relief bill on a party-line vote, using reconciliation to bypass the filibuster, are also pretty rich coming from a party that did exactly that in 2017, when it enacted a large tax cut — legislation that, unlike pandemic relief, wasn’t a response to any obvious crisis, but was simply part of a conservative wish list.

Oh, and that tax cut was rammed through in the face of broad public opposition: Only 29 percent of Americans approved of the bill, while 56 percent disapproved. By contrast, the main provisions of the Biden plan are very popular: 79 percent of the public approve of new stimulus checks, and 69 percent approve of both expanded unemployment benefits and aid to state and local governments.

So when one party is trying to pursue policies with overwhelming public support while the other offers lock-step opposition, who, exactly, is being divisive?

Wait, there’s more.

Everyone knew that Republicans, who abruptly stopped caring about deficits when Donald Trump took office, would suddenly rediscover the horror of debt under Joe Biden. What even I didn’t expect was to see them complain that Biden’s plan gives too much help to relatively affluent families.

Again, consider the 2017 tax cut. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, that law gave 79 percent of its benefits to people making more than $100,000 a year. It gave more to Americans with million-dollar-plus incomes, just 0.4 percent of taxpayers, than the total tax break for those living on less than $75,000 a year, that is, a majority of the population. And now Republicans claim to care about equity?

In short, everything about this Republican counteroffer reeks of bad faith — the same kind of bad faith the G.O.P. displayed in 2009 when it tried to block President Barack Obama’s efforts to rescue the economy after the 2008 financial crisis.

Obama, unfortunately, failed to grasp the nature of his opposition, and he watered down his policies in a vain attempt to win support across the aisle. This time, it seems as if Democrats understand what Lucy will do with that football and won’t be fooled again.

So it’s OK for Biden to talk with Republicans and hear them out. But should he make any substantive concessions in an attempt to win them over? Should he let negotiations with Republicans delay the passage of his rescue plan? Absolutely not. Just get it done."

Early in the Covid-19 pandemic NYC was hurting for PPE. Supplies that go to the Port Authority were frequently being intercepted by unnamed federal authorities and redirected.

This was...unique. Around the same time Trump made statements about wanting governors to be ""nicer"" to him.

Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots fueled up his team's airplane and sent it to China, loaded it up with PPE, flew it back to Boston, loaded his team's trucks and busses with the haul.

Massachusetts State Troopers, fully armed, escorted the convoy to the New York State line. They were met and the convoy was handed off to New York State Troopers.

And then... The New England Patriots bus received a full lights on, armed, combat ready escort from the Massachusetts border all the way to New York City. Both states ready to draw down on federal agents to save lives.

And if you don't believe me, the LA Times documented the whole thing.

Only a small percentage of those unaccounted for doses — roughly 2 million, two officials said — is due to lags in data reporting, the Biden team believes.

In the COVID-19 era, this is the new version of “letting down your hair.” So before I go on, here might be a good place to mention, reader, that Trump, the man who has lied every day for the last two months claiming that he won the 2020 election by a landslide, has repeatedly dismissed Jill’s story about the girl named in the lawsuit as “total nonsense.” Lisa Bloom, Phi Beta Kappa from UCLA, Yale Law, attorney for Bill O’Reilly accusers and later—disastrously—a lead lawyer for Harvey Weinstein, a fact that will blacken her formally superb reputation , sees some of Jill’s tweets and replies: “If you’re interested, follow and DM me.”"

So, is it finally OK to use the F-word?

One shouldn’t use the term “fascist” lightly. It isn’t a catchall for “people you disagree with.” It isn’t even a synonym for “bad political actors.” Mitch McConnell’s brand of politics has, in my view, greatly damaged America; but cynical legislative maneuvers aren’t the same thing as threatening and encouraging violence, and I wouldn’t call McConnell a fascist.

Donald Trump, however, is indeed a fascist — an authoritarian willing to use violence to achieve his racial nationalist goals. So are many of his supporters. If you had any doubts about that, Wednesday’s attack on Congress should have ended them.

And if history teaches us one lesson about dealing with fascists, it is the futility of appeasement. Giving in to fascists doesn’t pacify them, it just encourages them to go further.

So why have so many public figures — who should have known what Trump and his movement were — tried, again and again, to placate them by giving in to their demands? Why are they still doing it even now?

Consider a few milestones on the way to the sacking of the Capitol.

One big step happened in February, when every Republican senator other than Mitt Romney voted against convicting the president on impeachment charges despite clear evidence of his guilt. Susan Collins famously justified her vote by hoping that Trump had “learned his lesson.” What he actually learned was that he could abuse his power with impunity.

Another big step came in the spring, when armed protesters, with Trump’s encouragement, menaced Michigan authorities over Covid-19 restrictions. That dress rehearsal for this week’s violence drew some tut-tutting from Republican politicians, but no serious pushback. Indeed, one of the leaders in these events, Meshawn Maddock — who was also involved in Wednesday’s rioting — is in line to become co-chair of the Michigan G.O.P.

Again, the lesson was clear: Right-wing activists can get away with threatening elected officials, even when this includes brandishing weapons in public spaces.

Then came Trump’s unprecedented refusal to accept electoral defeat. Many Republicans joined him in trying to reject the will of the voters — almost two-thirds of House Republicans voted against accepting Pennsylvania’s electors after the Trumpist riot.

But even those who didn’t actively join his attempts to stage a coup tried to let Trump and his followers down easy. McConnell waited more than a month before accepting Joe Biden as president-elect. One senior Republican said to The Washington Post, “What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?” Well, now we know the answer.

Finally, what happened on Wednesday? A Trumpist attack during the confirmation of Biden’s victory was completely predictable. So why was security so lax? Why were there hardly any arrests?

What we know suggests that the people who were in charge of protecting Congress failed to do so because they didn’t want to be seen treating the MAGA mob as the danger it was. The Wall Street Journal reported that Defense Department officials worried about the optics of having military personnel on the steps of the Capitol — something that didn’t concern them during the far less threatening Black Lives Matter protests last year. But The Associated Press reported that Defense Department officials say Capitol Police turned down offers of help.

And once again the attempt to appease fascists will surely end up encouraging them. So far, the lesson for Trumpist extremists is that they can engage in violent attacks on the core institutions of American democracy, and face hardly any consequences. Clearly, they view their exploits as a triumph, and will be eager to do more.

For this isn’t over. If you aren’t terrified about what Trump might do between now and Inauguration Day, you haven’t been paying attention. And I can’t be the only person worried about what will happen during the inauguration itself.

After the failure to protect Congress, how can we be sure there will be adequate security during the presidential transition? Not long ago such concerns might have seemed paranoid, but now they seem utterly reasonable.

And even if the inauguration goes off smoothly, the threat will remain. If you imagine that the people who stormed the Capitol will just go away once Biden is installed in the White House, you’re delusional.

So what can be done? It’s time to stop appeasing the fascists among us. Law enforcement should seek to arrest as many of the participants in Wednesday’s attack as possible — some have already been identified, and there’s video evidence that should make it easy to identify many more.

And anyone who tries to violently interfere with the transfer of power should also be arrested.

Finally, there needs to be an accounting for whatever crimes took place during the past four years — and does anyone doubt that Trump allies and associates engaged in criminal acts? Don’t say that we should look forward, not back; accountability for past actions will be crucial if we want the future to be better.

Appeasement is what got us to where we are. It has to stop, now."

Fauci called HCQ an effective treatment and cure for covid in another published paper, and somehow third world countries that have it available over the counter did just fine. We banned it from being prescribed in some states, and a woman used it to kill her husband. She even got arrested for it, but the media didn't report that once.

If masks work, then why did we have to release all the violent criminals from prison? To make room for people abducted from family gatherings? You had 6 people over, we're sending you to gen pop without a mask. Logic!

If not obesity, then smokers. Lets shoot to kill all tobacco users and alcoholics while we're at it. They contribute to more deaths than covid did. How about heroin dealers?

&gt; **Income is the main determinant of covid mortality.** 

The implication is that we would kill more people with a lockdown than would be killed if we just let the virus run rampant through the population, since the lockdown would cost some people income, and the author thinks that a lack of money is what is killing Covid's victims, and not the virus itself.

But of course, the reason poor people are more likely to die from the virus is they are less likely to receive quality care, and are less capable of social distancing. Poorer people tend to do jobs that can't be done from home, and they can't afford to pay more to have things delivered to them. The virus doesn't infect them because their checking accounts are overdrawn, it's infecting them because they're exposed to people who were already infected themselves.

As for treatment, the fact is that social distancing and masking help keep hospitals from being overwhelmed. If they do become overwhelmed with Covid patients, then poor people will have even fewer treatment options than before, and will die at even higher rates.

Alex Gutentag and the idiots at The Bellows want to make EVERYTHING about class warfare, including viruses. But viruses aren't sentient, and so they don't understand wealth and poverty. They infect people who are exposed, regardless of social class. They kill people who are untreated, regardless of whether or not those people have money in their bank accounts. So the way to protect poor people from the virus is not to lift restrictions and pretend that having a steady income can protect a person against the virus. Instead, we should be requiring masks and social distancing in public spaces, sending checks and rent vouchers to those who need them, ensuring treatment to everyone who is infected, and making vaccinations available to all as quickly as possible."

1145,1145,1608663268,"&gt;Researchers discovered the UK and South Africa variants by sequencing the genomes of virus samples from positive patients. The UK, the leader in genomic sequencing for Covid-19, examines about 10 percent of all confirmed cases, using the information to guide shelter-in-place recommendations. This month, UK researchers have uploaded 2,131 full sequences to an international repository, GISAID. U.S. researchers, on the other hand, have uploaded only 36—despite having five times more people in the country, and hundreds of thousands of cases. “We’re flying blind. Totally flying blind right now,” Dr. Michael Worobey, head of the ecology and evolutionary biology department at the University of Arizona, told me.

&gt;It’s important to track genetic changes to the virus for two main reasons: first, to know whether the variants identified in the UK and South Africa are already here, and second, to see what other homegrown variants are emerging. Viruses evolve frequently, making tiny changes every time they replicate. The more chances they have to replicate—each time they infect a new person—the more likely they are to mutate. That means the more cases we have, the more opportunities the virus has to change. Most of these changes are harmless, especially when they happen bit by bit. As the viruses evolve, our immune systems also change to combat them. But when they mutate quickly and substantially, as the UK variant has done, they may be able to elude our immune responses even when we’ve already had an infection or a vaccine. And that’s what has experts worried.

&gt;“This is the first variant that got my attention,” Worobey said. “The vast, vast, vast, vast majority of mutations don’t have any important effect. Things are really driven by human behavior. But this is the first one, and the South Africa one is another one, where it’s pretty dramatic.” The variant identified in South Africa spread to account for nearly all of the country’s cases in a matter of weeks. Its three mutations may make it easier for the virus to bind to receptors, officials said, and it seems to increase the patients’ viral load—potentially making them more contagious. In addition, more serious cases than usual have been reported in children and young adults with no preexisting conditions who contract this variant, but it’s not clear whether it’s because young people are more vulnerable to the mutated virus or because many schools have stayed open. This is also a concern with the virus variant in the UK, with as many as 23 mutations—a surprisingly fast change that experts didn’t expect to see for at least another year—that may aid the virus in spreading significantly faster. “It’s definitely the world record-holder for just a whole bunch of mutations that have never been seen before all of a sudden, instantaneously, appearing in a new genome,” Worobey said.

SNIP

&gt;But scientists and officials are taking the new variants seriously—in part because of concern for what these more substantial mutations might mean for the efficacy of vaccines that have only just been released. “There is reason to think that this new variant might actually be able to infect people who have already been affected by earlier variants, because it’s so different,” Worobey said. “And maybe the vaccine might be less protective against this new variant. No one knows the answers to those questions yet; lots of people are working on it rapidly. But it’s a possibility for sure.”

&gt;It usually takes a long time for a virus to evolve until a vaccine stops working entirely. More likely, Worobey said, the spread of new variants would simply make a vaccine a little less effective—not negate it completely. Researchers are racing to learn whether the virus has changed enough to reinfect people who already had it, whether the illness is more or less severe, and whether the vaccine still works very well against it. “This is a one-in-a-million event, for sure. Just off the charts,” Worobey said. But one-in-a-million events may become a lot more common when you have a million new cases every four days, as the U.S. now does."

---

The not-a-stimulus deal Congress reached over the weekend — seriously, this is about disaster relief, not boosting the economy — didn’t come a moment too soon. Actually, it came much too late: Crucial aid to many unemployed Americans and businesses expired months ago. But now some of that aid is back, for a while.

True, the aid will be less generous than it was in the spring and summer: $300 a week in enhanced unemployment benefits, rather than $600. But because the workers still out of a job as a result of the pandemic tended to have low earnings even before the coronavirus struck, they will, on average, be receiving something like 85 percent of their pre-Covid-19 income.

By the way, although the one-time $600 checks to a much wider group of Americans are getting much of the media coverage, they account for only a small percentage of the overall expense and are far less crucial than the unemployment benefits to keeping families afloat.

So what’s not to like about this relief package? There’s some dumb stuff, like a tax break for corporate meal expenses — fighting a deadly pandemic with three-martini lunches. But the serious problem with this deal is that economic aid will end far too soon: Enhanced unemployment benefits will last just 11 weeks. And the process by which the deal was reached has ominous implications for the future.

Why isn’t 11 weeks of aid enough? Because we won’t be able to begin a vigorous economic recovery until a large fraction of the population is vaccinated, which might not happen until the summer or even the early fall. And we’re still down around 10 million jobs from pre-Covid levels; even if we can regain jobs as quickly as we did during the false dawn of May and June (when the Trump administration insisted that the pandemic was ending), it will take months more before we’re anywhere close to full employment.

So while the new legislation provides a sort of bridge to the post-Covid future, it’s a bridge that spans only part of the chasm ahead. And the way the bill was passed offers few reasons to be optimistic about Republican willingness to let the Biden administration finish the project.

Remember, until recently Mitch McConnell showed little interest in passing any kind of relief package. And there’s no mystery about what changed his mind: It was all about the Senate runoffs in Georgia. “Kelly [Loeffler] and David [Perdue] are getting hammered” over the failure to provide aid, he told his political allies.

Once those races end on Jan. 5, McConnell’s sure to lose interest all over again. And unless Democrats win both elections, he’ll still be Senate majority leader, in a position to stand in the way of any further economic relief.

Beyond that, the final hurdles to reaching an agreement were a reminder of something we should have learned during the Obama years: When a Democrat is in the White House, Republicans try to sabotage the economy. And the sabotage doesn’t stop with using phony deficit concerns to block necessary spending; it also involves deliberately increasing the risk of financial crisis.

Remember, G.O.P. flimflam when Barack Obama was president went beyond posing as deficit hawks to block needed fiscal stimulus. It also involved constant criticism and harassment of the Fed over its efforts to rescue the economy. And now it’s happening again.

Some background: Although the pandemic recession was deep and ugly, it could easily have been even uglier. For a few weeks in March, America teetered on the edge of a financial crisis approaching the meltdown following the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Fortunately, however, this incipient crisis was quickly contained by the Federal Reserve, which stabilized markets both by purchasing trillions of dollars’ worth of financial assets and by making it clear that it would do even more if necessary.

That was a job well done. But the risk of financial crisis hasn’t gone away, so we want to make sure that the Fed has the tools to meet future challenges.

Yet last month Steven Mnuchin, the blessedly departing Treasury secretary, gratuitously clawed back hundreds of billions of dollars in budget backing for Fed emergency lending programs, making those funds unavailable to his successor. And talks over economic relief almost fell apart over a last-minute demand by Senator Pat Toomey, backed by the Republican leadership, that the legislation bar the Fed from restarting some of these programs or anything like them.

In the end, this poison pill appears to have been rendered mostly harmless, with face-saving language that prevents exact copycat programs but seems to leave room for slightly different programs that would achieve the same results.

But the episode was a preview of things to come. If another crisis develops, expect Republicans to do all they can to prevent an effective response.

So how should we feel about this relief deal? The glass is half full: For millions of American families, the next few months will be less hellish than they would have been otherwise. The glass is half empty: Unless Democrats win those Georgia seats, expect an ugly spring and years of economic sabotage ahead."

The economic policy of the Donald Trump administration is characterized by individual and corporate tax cuts, attempts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (""Obamacare""), trade protectionism, immigration restriction, deregulation focused on the energy and financial sectors, and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. A key part of President Trump's economic strategy during his first three years (2017–2019) was to boost economic growth via tax cuts and additional spending, both of which significantly increased federal budget deficits. The positive economic situation he inherited from President Obama continued, with a labor market approaching full employment and measures of household income and wealth continuing to improve further into record territory. President Trump also implemented trade protectionism via tariffs, primarily on imports from China, as part of his ""America First"" strategy.

---

It seems obvious that this is not a good moment for Republicans. They just lost a presidential election, the seventh of the past eight in which Democrats won the popular vote. Their policy agenda, to the extent they have one, is enormously unpopular; the public isn’t exactly crying out to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut rich people’s taxes.

And chances are that the whiny, infantile loser in the Oval Office will keep his grip on their party for the foreseeable future, driving every sane person in the party to distraction.

But what if that’s the wrong way to look at it? What if the GOP’s current standing is actually nothing short of miraculous?

That certainly seems to be what some people in the party think. As Politico reports, far from engaging in a round of soul-searching after their election loss, Republicans believe that they could hardly be in better shape.

Not only did they do far better in down-ballot races than expected, but also lots of them believe that President Trump lost only because of fraud, which would mean there’s no problem the party has that can’t be solved with some more voter suppression. Just make some adjustments to their turnout strategy (such as refraining from telling their voters not to vote by mail) and future victories are assured.

As one party official from Michigan put it to Politico: “As far as I’m concerned, everything’s great.""

For those of us who have spent time contemplating the GOP’s long-term problems, that sounds preposterous. Republicans are weak with women, with minorities, with young people, and as we saw in this election, even with people in growing suburbs. In a country becoming more diverse by the day, they’re firmly committed to representing White Christians, who are steadily declining as a proportion of the population.

But consider what they have going for them.

The American system as currently constituted gives Republicans a panoply of advantages and means of exercising disproportionate power. The electoral college helps them win elections they lose, which they’ve done twice in the past 20 years. Even this year, with Joe Biden beating Trump by 7 million votes, they came closer than people realize to snatching another such victory: Had Trump gotten just 43,000 more votes in Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin, it would have been a 269-to-269 tie and the House of Representatives would have made Trump president for a second term.

Then you have the absurdly antidemocratic Senate, where the fewer than 600,000 people who live in Wyoming get the same representation as the nearly 40 million who live in California. Though millions more Americans voted to be represented in the Senate by Democrats, Republicans hold the majority.

Republicans' commitment to gerrymandering has given them outsize power in both the House and state legislatures, and because Democrats didn’t do better in 2020, the next round of redistricting won’t change much. The Supreme Court has given them a hand, eviscerating the Voting Rights Act and declaring that even the most brutal partisan gerrymanders are constitutional. And of course, that Supreme Court now has a 6-to-3 conservative supermajority.

Republicans also have an extraordinarily effective media apparatus they’ve built up over recent decades, which amplifies even the most ludicrous propaganda and keeps their voters in a state of perpetual agitation.

And what did the Trump presidency teach them? As if his corruption and lying and vulgarity and authoritarian tendencies weren’t enough, Trump is responsible for what may be the most catastrophic failure any American president has committed in our country’s history. More than 300,000 Americans and counting are dead from covid-19, and more than 20 million are out of work. And yet his party paid almost no price.

He may have been held accountable at the voting booth, but they weren’t. Given all that, should we be surprised that Republicans don’t see any reason to change?

Besides, change is hard. There are some Republicans who want to devise a new agenda that could expand the party’s appeal, but that’s no easy task, and it might demobilize some core supporters, which would mean short-term risks in order to achieve long-term benefits. Those who advocate change are losing the argument to others in the party who say, “No thanks — this White racial resentment thing is working pretty well, so we’ll just stick with it for now.”

Republicans might even conclude that losing the presidency is not that bad in the end. It’s not as though they were doing much with it anyway. Once they passed an enormous tax cut for the wealthy and corporations in 2017, they pretty much stopped legislating. Trump certainly used the power of the executive branch in whatever ways he could, but if Republicans hold the Senate, they’ll be able to hamstring the Biden administration in all kinds of ways, increasing the likelihood that his presidency is a failure and putting themselves in a good position to win back the White House in 2024.

Even before then, the swing of the electoral pendulum will probably give them a sweeping victory in the 2022 midterms. And as they know, that is likely to happen regardless of what they do between now and then.

That’s because, as the GOP’s fortunes prove, ours is a system with almost no accountability. They can be dishonest and hypocritical and reckless, and it won’t matter. They can throw sand in the gears of government and voters will blame “Washington,” then punish the president’s party even if it was the opposition’s fault.

Republicans can welcome QAnon lunatics into their coalition, lie endlessly about fictional election fraud, destroy America’s position in the world, lift up the worst president we’ve ever had, show again and again that they’d be incapable of running a corner lemonade stand let alone the U.S. government, and none of it matters.

So yes, from where they stand, “everything’s great.” How could they conclude otherwise?"

He's talking about deliberately letting about **six million people die.** Because that's what the MINIMUM fatality amount would be from just COVID alone. There would probably be about another 1-2 million who would die because the entire US healthcare system would collapse under the strain of it, every severe medical condition needing an ICU would be a death sentence and probably half the frontline heathcare workers would simply walk off the job rather than go insane from the strain.

President Biden has no choice - he must name a special prosecutor to look into this, Kushner's activities and the PPP scandals. 

&gt;The new emails present a striking look into Caputo and Alexander’s attempts to downplay the pandemic as the coronavirus spread rapidly across the country, especially the Sun Belt, and the death toll rose.

&gt;“As the virus spread through the country, these officials callously wrote, ‘who cares’ and ‘we want them infected,‘” Clyburn said in a statement. “They privately admitted they ‘always knew’ the President’s policies would cause a ‘rise’ in cases, and they plotted to blame the spread of the virus on career scientists.” 

&gt;On June 24, amid the post-Memorial Day surge in cases, Alexander wrote to Caputo and two other HHS officials, “we always knew as you relax and open up, cases will rise.” He then questioned, “but are the new cases problematic???”

&gt;“We need also to tout the good stories as we know of elderly with serious conditions who get it and survive…this is key to tell,” he added.

&gt;Throughout the emails, Alexander heavily criticized top government scientific advisors, including Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In a July 3 email to Caputo and other HHS communications officials when U.S. cases stood at just under 2.8 million, Alexander lamented that Fauci warned the public to “expect a dramatic increase in spread.”

---

Though it may be hard to imagine now, sometime in the not distant future, the emergency measures adopted this year to control the spread of COVID-19 will no longer be necessary. But California would benefit by keeping at least one of them in place for good: mailing a ballot to every active registered voter in the state.

When it became clear this spring that the pandemic was not likely to end before the Nov. 3 election, lawmakers acted to ensure that all active registered voters in California could participate without risking infection. Counties were directed to mail ballots to all voters, whether they requested one or not, and, with an onslaught of mail ballots expected, were allowed to start processing ballots extra early. The state also extended the grace period for mailed-in ballots to 17 days.

It was a wise move that paid off. By all measures, the Nov. 3 election in California was held successfully, despite all the wild-eyed stories and false tales of mail ballot fraud spread by the president and his loyalists. (In the end, the only potential large-scale voting fraud in California was perpetrated by the California Republican Party, which set up dozens of phony ballot drop boxes in violation of state law. )

Nearly 18 million Californians voted in this election, more than ever before. So many Californians voted early — motivated, perhaps, by the stories about possible mail delivery delays — that election day was relatively calm, with only a few long lines reported around the state. This is exactly how every election should go, pandemic or not. Why backtrack now?

That’s what Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), chairman of the Assembly Elections Committee, thinks too. He has proposed legislation to require counties to automatically send mail ballots to all active registered voters (some already do) and to offer tracking services so voters can make sure their ballots are received. This wouldn’t end in-person voting for those who need assistance or enjoy casting their ballot in the company of others, but it would let voters easily choose how and where they vote.

This change would only hasten a trend well underway in California. In the last four statewide general elections, most voters used mail ballots. Even without the emergency legislation this year, about 75% of the state’s voters would have been mailed a ballot, and about 90% of registered voters would be receiving a mail ballot in future elections, according to the Secretary of State’s office.

It just makes sense to standardize this clearly popular voting choice. It’s where California has been headed since the Legislature passed the Voter’s Choice Act in 2016 and allowed counties to ditch the traditional model of in-person voting on election day at many small precincts in favor of centralized vote centers where ballots could be dropped off or cast in person well in advance. Fifteen counties, Los Angeles County among them, have adopted those provisions.

But we need ballot drop boxes too. The Voter’s Choice Act doesn’t require counties to deploy them, but drop boxes should be mandatory if we move to universal mail ballots. In Los Angeles County, drop boxes were wildly popular — more than half of the 3.4 million mail ballots cast in the Nov. 3 election were collected that way.

Another election problem that lawmakers should fix: This year’s emergency arrangement notwithstanding, California law provides a grace period of only three days for ballots to arrive after the election (they must be postmarked by election day to be counted). That seems too short, given that it takes the Postal Service up to a week to deliver first-class mail.

And for heaven’s sake, lawmakers really ought to revise the 2016 law that allows unlimited third-party collection of ballots, or “ballot harvesting.” Previously, only a member of the family or household could deliver a ballot on behalf of a registered voter. We were worried about the potential for misuse even before it was used to justify the GOP’s fake drop boxes. We have no doubt that in future elections, there will be other creative uses of this law that undermine trust in democracy.

While we’re making an election reform wish list, Congress should use its authority over the “times, places and manner” of federal elections to standardize procedures for collecting and processing mail ballots. Ideally, those standards would look like those in California, where officials have gone out of their way to make voting easier and smoother — and are still looking for ways to do it better."

---

The next few months will be terrible. Several thousand Americans are now dying from Covid-19 every day; given the lag between cases and deaths, the daily toll will almost certainly rise through the end of this year, and if people are careless over Christmas it could surge even higher in the new year. Economic recovery has stalled, with employment still down almost 10 million from pre-pandemic levels.

The most we can hope for at this point are policies that mitigate the suffering, getting us through the horror while we wait for widespread vaccination. And a few days ago it seemed possible that we would in fact get some good news on the economic front. A bipartisan group of senators seemed close to agreement on a Covid relief bill that would fall far short of what we should be doing, but would be much better than nothing.

Then the lame-duck Trump administration intervened — destructively.

Before I get to what’s wrong with the administration’s proposal and why it may do a great deal of harm, let’s talk about what the goal of economic policy ought to be right now.

I still keep seeing news reports that frame congressional arguments about relief bills as a debate about “stimulus.” But stimulus is what you do when unemployment is high because people aren’t spending enough. And that’s not the problem we face.

Think about it. Why are there still two million fewer workers in “food services and drinking places” than there were before the coronavirus struck? It’s not because people can’t afford to eat out or go to bars. It’s because eating out and gathering in bars are dangerous activities. In many parts of the country these activities are, rightly, either banned or sharply restricted; even where they’re allowed, many people, understanding the risks, choose to stay home.

The role of economic policy in this situation isn’t to bring those jobs back while the pandemic is still raging — we actually don’t want a resurgence of employment in high-risk sectors until vaccines are widely available. What we should be doing, instead, is minimizing the suffering while we wait. That is, the issue isn’t stimulus, it’s disaster relief.

What should this relief involve? It should provide support for the unavoidably unemployed, sustain businesses through the dark months ahead and aid state and local governments that are suffering severe declines in revenues and that will otherwise be forced to make drastic cuts in essential services.

And no, this last problem isn’t restricted to blue states. In fact, six of the seven states expected to face the biggest revenue declines have Republican governors.

House Democrats have always been willing to pass a relief bill along the lines I’ve described. And as I said, until a few days ago the Senate appeared to be moving toward a bill that, while much smaller than Democrats wanted, would be better than nothing. The main obstacle seemed to be the determination of Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, to include a poison pill — a blanket exemption of businesses from any liabilities related to exposing their workers to Covid-19 risks. But observers were hopeful that an agreement could still be reached.

Then came the Trump administration intervention — a proposal from Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, that McConnell quickly endorsed even though it was disastrously wrongheaded.

I’m not sure whether the coverage of this discussion has fully explained just how bad Mnuchin’s proposal is. Many headlines emphasized the cost, a bit over $900 billion, which was similar to that of the emerging bipartisan bill, suggesting that the administration was weighing in with something positive.

In fact, however, the administration proposal completely eliminated the most important piece of any relief deal — expanded benefits for the unemployed — replacing it with one-time $600 checks that would be sent to everyone.

Again, think about it. For Americans who won’t be able to return to work while the pandemic is still raging, a one-time payment of $600 is grossly inadequate, while for those who haven’t lost their jobs it’s unnecessary. It’s true that people might spend some of the grant, boosting overall demand — but overall lack of demand isn’t the main problem right now.

So what is Mnuchin thinking? We can’t rule out sheer ignorance. It is, sad to say, entirely possible that, nine months into the pandemic slump, administration officials still don’t understand the basic logic of relief. Or they may be in thrall to the thoroughly debunked myth that unemployment benefits actually cause high unemployment.

Or maybe this proposal reflects the expiring administration’s special combination of delusion and cynicism. President Trump is still trying, in ever more desperate and destructive ways, to overturn the results of the election. And in his madness he may imagine that he will gain more politically from sending everyone another check with his name on it than from helping those truly in need.

Whatever the motivation, Mnuchin’s proposal couldn’t have come at a worse time. It may well undermine the economic relief millions of Americans need."

That's fine, but there's still the issue of standing.  Your argument could be made by the state legislatures themselves if they objected to the change, especially if they had not delegated authority to run the details of the election to their secretaries of state, granted their governors authority over COVID relief, or whatever.  And I believe that argument has already been made and rejected at the state level at least in some states.

The question again is what gives Texas any standing to object to the state political process in any place other than Texas, let alone take it to the supreme court?

It's a little like calling CPS because you don't agree with the way your neighbors assign chores to their children.  Maybe mind your own damn business?

---

President Trump’s continuing attempts to overturn an election he lost decisively more than a month ago is, like so much of what he’s done in office, shocking but not surprising. Who imagined that he would go quietly?

What some people may not have been fully prepared for is the way Trump’s party as a whole has backed his dangerous delusions. According to a survey by The Washington Post, only 27 Republican members of Congress are willing to say that Joe Biden won. Despite the complete lack of evidence of significant fraud, two-thirds of self-identified Republicans said in a Reuters/Ipsos poll that the election was rigged.

But you really shouldn’t be surprised by this willingness to indulge malicious, democracy-endangering lies. After all, when was the last time Republicans accepted a politically inconvenient fact? It has been clear for years that the modern G.O.P. is a party that can’t handle the truth.

Most obviously, Republican refusal to accept the election results follows months of refusal to acknowledge the dangers of the coronavirus, even as Covid-19 has become the nation’s leading cause of death, and even as a startling number of people in Trump’s orbit have been infected.

Sure enough, virus denial and vote denial converged almost perfectly on Saturday, when Trump addressed a large, mostly unmasked crowd in Georgia — creating a potential superspreader event — and demanded that the governor overturn the state’s election results. The next day Rudy Giuliani, who has been directing Trump’s efforts to cling to office, was hospitalized with the virus.

The thing is, Republican rejection of reality didn’t start in 2020, or even with the Trump era. Climate change denial — including claims that global warming is a hoax perpetrated by an international cabal of scientists — has been a badge of partisan identity for many years. Crazy conspiracy theories about the Clintons were mainstream on the right through much of the 1990s.

And one half-forgotten episode in particular seems to me to have foreshadowed much of what we’re seeing right now: Republican reactions to the mostly successful introduction of Obamacare.

The Affordable Care Act went into full effect in 2014, amid dire predictions by Republicans. The act, they claimed, would drive insurance premiums sky-high, fail to reduce the number of uninsured, and have a devastating effect on employment.

None of that happened. Instead, millions of Americans gained health insurance coverage. Job creation continued, with three million jobs added in the year following the A.C.A.’s implementation. Obamacare may have fallen somewhat short of its sponsors’ hopes (although nobody expected it to yield universal coverage), but from the beginning it helped many Americans, and was nothing like the disaster opponents predicted.

As far as I can tell, however, no prominent Republican was willing to admit that the party’s apocalyptic warnings had been proved false, let alone talk about why they were wrong. Nor, of course, did Republicans make any effort to come up with a better health plan. (It has been almost 11 years since Obamacare was signed into law, and we’re still waiting.) Instead, party leaders simply pretended that the promised catastrophe had, in fact, materialized.

For example, John Boehner, the speaker of the House at the time, insisted that there had been a “net loss” of people with health insurance. After that three million-job gain, Jeb Bush (remember him?) insisted that Obamacare was “the greatest job suppressor in the so-called recovery.”

And in a move that prefigured the Trump team’s desperate attempts to find evidence for election fraud, right-wing groups went in search of health care horror stories, tales of ordinary Americans devastated by Obamacare.

To be fair, while there is no evidence of significant electoral fraud, some people really were hurt by health reform — mainly young, healthy individuals who previously had cheap policies and made too much money to be eligible for subsidies. But these weren’t the victims Republicans were looking for. Instead, they peddled tales of older, working-class Americans who supposedly had lost access to affordable insurance.

None of these tales stood up to scrutiny. But that didn’t matter to the G.O.P. As I wrote at the time, Republicans had already — pre-Trump — entered the era of post-truth politics.

Now, there’s obviously a big difference in immediate impact between refusing to accept evidence that contradicts your policy preconceptions and refusing to accept the results of an election. But the mind-set is the same.

The point is that once a party gets into the habit of rejecting facts it doesn’t want to hear, one fact it’s bound to reject sooner or later is the fact that it lost an election. In that sense there’s a straight line from, say, the Republican embrace of climate denial to the party’s willingness to go along with Trump’s attempts to retain power.

And the G.O.P.’s previous history of dealing with inconvenient reality gives us a pretty good idea about when the party will accept Joe Biden as the legitimate winner of the 2020 election — namely, never."

---

When Joe Biden is inaugurated, he will immediately be confronted with an unprecedented challenge — and I don’t mean the pandemic, although Covid-19 will almost surely be killing thousands of Americans every day. I mean, instead, that he’ll be the first modern U.S. president trying to govern in the face of an opposition that refuses to accept his legitimacy. And no, Democrats never said Donald Trump was illegitimate, just that he was incompetent and dangerous.

It goes without saying that Donald Trump, whose conspiracy theories are getting wilder and wilder, will never concede, and that millions of his followers will always believe — or at least say they believe — that the election was stolen.

Most Republicans in Congress certainly know this is a lie, although even on Capitol Hill there are a lot more crazy than we’d like to imagine. But it doesn’t matter; they still won’t accept that Biden has any legitimacy, even though he won the popular vote by a large margin.

And this won’t simply be because they fear a backlash from the base if they admit that Trump lost fair and square. At a fundamental level — and completely separate from the Trump factor — today’s G.O.P. doesn’t believe that Democrats ever have the right to govern, no matter how many votes they receive.

After all, in recent years we’ve seen what happens when a state with a Republican legislature elects a Democratic governor: Legislators quickly try to strip away the governor’s powers. So does anyone doubt that Republicans will do all they can to hobble and sabotage Biden’s presidency?

The only real questions are how much harm the G.O.P. can do, and how Biden will respond.

The answer to the first question depends a lot on what happens in the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate runoffs. If Democrats win both seats, they’ll have effective though narrow control of both houses of Congress. If they don’t, Mitch McConnell will have enormous powers of obstruction — and anyone who doubts that he’ll use those powers to undermine Biden at every turn is living in a fantasy world.

But how much damage would obstructionism inflict? In terms of economic policy — which is all I’ll talk about in this column — the near future can be divided into two eras, pre- and post-vaccine (or more accurately, after wide dissemination of a vaccine).

For the next few months, as the pandemic continues to run wild, tens of millions of Americans will be in desperate straits unless the federal government steps up to help. Unfortunately, Republicans may be in a position to block this help.

The good news about the very near future, such as it is, is that Americans will probably (and correctly) blame Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, for the misery they’re experiencing — and this very fact may make Republicans willing to cough up at least some money.

What about the post-vaccine economy? Here again there’s potentially some good news: Once a vaccine becomes widely available, we’ll probably see a spontaneous economic recovery, one that won’t depend on Republican cooperation. And there will also be a vast national sense of relief.

So Biden might do OK for a while even in the face of scorched-earth Republican opposition. But we can’t be sure of that. Republicans might refuse to confirm anyone for key economic positions. There’s always the possibility of another financial crisis — and outgoing Trump officials have been systematically undermining the incoming administration’s ability to deal with such a crisis if it happens. And America desperately needs action on issues from infrastructure, to climate change, to tax enforcement that won’t happen if Republicans retain blocking power.

So what can Biden do?

First, he needs to start talking about immediate policy actions to help ordinary Americans, if only to make it clear to Georgia voters how much damage will be done if they don’t elect Democrats to those two Senate seats.

If Democrats don’t get those seats, Biden will need to use executive action to accomplish as much as possible despite Republican obstruction — although I worry that the Trump-stacked Supreme Court will try to block him when he does.

Finally, although Biden is still talking in a comforting way about unity and reaching across the aisle, at some point he’ll need to stop reassuring us that he’s nothing like Trump and start making Republicans pay a political price for their attempts to prevent him from governing.

Now, I don’t mean that he should sound like Trump, demanding retribution against his enemies — although the Justice Department should be allowed to do its job and prosecute whatever Trump-era crimes it finds.

No, what Biden needs to do is what Harry Truman did in 1948, when he built political support by running against “do-nothing” Republicans. And he’ll have a better case than Truman ever did, because today’s Republicans are infinitely more corrupt and less patriotic than the Republicans Truman faced.

The results of this year’s election, with a solid Biden win but Republicans doing well down-ballot, tells us that American voters don’t fully understand what the modern G.O.P. is really about. Biden needs to get that point across, and make Republicans pay for the sabotage we all know is coming."

---

The next few months are going to be incredibly grim. The pandemic is exploding, but Donald Trump is tweeting while America burns. His officials, unwilling to admit that he lost the election, are refusing even to share coronavirus data with the Biden team.

As a result, many preventable deaths will occur before a vaccine’s widespread distribution. And the economy will take a hit, too; travel is declining, an early indicator of a slowdown in job growth and possibly even a return to job losses as virus fears cause consumers to hunker down again.

But a vaccine is coming. Nobody is sure which of the promising candidates will prevail, or when they’ll be widely available. But it’s a good guess that we’ll get this pandemic under control at some point next year.

And it’s also a good bet that when we do the economy will come roaring back.

OK, this is not the consensus view. Most economic forecasters appear to be quite pessimistic; they expect a long, sluggish recovery that will take years to bring us back to anything resembling full employment. They worry a lot about long-term “scarring” from unemployment and closed businesses. And they could be right.

But my sense is that many analysts have overlearned the lessons from the 2008 financial crisis, which was indeed followed by years of depressed employment, defying the predictions of economists who expected the kind of “V-shaped” recovery the economy experienced after earlier deep slumps. For what it’s worth, I was among those who dissented back then, arguing that this was a different kind of recession, and that recovery would take a long time.

And here’s the thing: The same logic that predicted sluggish recovery from the last big slump points to a much faster recovery this time around — again, once the pandemic is under control.

What held recovery back after 2008? Most obviously, the bursting of the housing bubble left households with high levels of debt and greatly weakened balance sheets that took years to recover.

This time, however, households entered the pandemic slump with much lower debt. Net worth took a brief hit but quickly recovered. And there’s probably a lot of pent-up demand: Americans who remained employed did a huge amount of saving in quarantine, accumulating a lot of liquid assets.

All of this suggests to me that spending will surge once the pandemic subsides and people feel safe to go out and about, just as spending surged in 1982 when the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates. And this in turn suggests that Joe Biden will eventually preside over a soaring, “morning in America”-type recovery.

Which brings me to the politics. How should Biden play the good economic news if and when it comes?

First of all, he should celebrate it. I don’t expect Biden to engage in Trump-like boasting; he’s not that kind of guy, and his economics team will be composed of people who care about their professional reputations, not the quacks and hacks who populate the current administration. But he can highlight the good news, and point out how it refutes claims that progressive policies somehow prevent prosperity.

Also, Biden and his surrogates shouldn’t hesitate to call out Republicans, both in Washington and in state governments, when they try to sabotage the economy — which, of course, they will. I won’t even be surprised if we see G.O.P. efforts to impede the wide distribution of a vaccine.

What, do you think there are some lines a party refusing to cooperate with the incoming administration — and, in fact, still trying to steal the election — won’t cross?

Finally, while Biden should make the most of good economic news, he should try to build on success, not rest on his laurels. Short-term booms are no guarantee of longer-term prosperity. Despite the rapid recovery of 1982-1984, the typical American worker earned less, adjusted for inflation, at the end of Reagan’s presidency in 1989 than in 1979.

And while I’m optimistic about the immediate outlook for a post-vaccine economy, we’ll still need to invest on a large scale to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, improve the condition of America’s families (especially children) and, above all, head off catastrophic climate change.

So even if I’m right about the prospects for a Biden boom, the political benefits of that boom shouldn’t be cause for complacency; they should be harnessed in the service of fixing America for the long run.

And the fact that Biden may be able to do that is reason for hope.

Those of us worried about the future were relieved to see Trump defeated (even though it’s possible he’ll have to be removed forcibly from the White House), but bitterly disappointed by the failure of the expected blue wave to materialize down-ballot.

If I’m right, however, the peculiar nature of the coronavirus slump may give Democrats another big political opportunity. There’s a pretty good chance that they’ll be able to run in the 2022 midterms as the party that brought the nation and the economy back from the depths of Covid despond. And they should seize that opportunity, not just for their own sake, but for the sake of the nation and the world."

---

This was probably the way we should have expected President Trump to finish his time in the White House: whining, lying, ignoring the duties of his office, desperate to keep his scam going and focused only on himself. But that Trump is being Trump should not for one second blind us to what is happening right now and how damaging it is. The destruction of the past four years was apparently not enough for him. So on his way out the door, Trump is salting the earth behind him.

It has been nearly two weeks since the election. President-elect Joe Biden won the electoral college by 306-to-232. His lead in the popular vote is 5.6 million and growing. Republican efforts to get courts to shut down counting and invalidate huge numbers of votes are being laughed out of court. This is over.

And what is the president doing? Complaining on Twitter.

He will not prevail, and everyone knows it. The White House staffers desperately spinning on his behalf know it. The Fox News hosts propagating conspiracy theories about stolen votes know it. Every elected Republican knows it. The only ones who don’t know it are the millions of Trump voters who are the targets of this noxious propaganda campaign, the ones being told that American democracy is worthy of nothing but contempt.

Trump tells them that our system of elections is impossibly corrupt, that only the Republican Party can legitimately claim power no matter what the will of the public actually is, and even that street violence is not only justified but should be celebrated when committed by the far right.

Meanwhile, his White House instructs civil servants across the federal government to refuse to cooperate or even communicate with representatives of the incoming Biden administration, making the already complex task of the transition vastly more difficult. And while the coronavirus pandemic is positively exploding across the country — we’re now averaging more than 150,000 new cases and a thousand deaths per day — his administration has stopped even pretending it cares.

At the current pace, by the time Trump leaves office, more than 300,000 Americans will have died of covid-19. And even after he departs, every day more will die because Trump politicized simple public health measures, convincing his supporters that refusing to wear a mask to protect yourself and those around you is a great way to own the libs.

No president in American history has ever before spent the end of his time in office trying to discredit our democracy, degrade the federal government and set Americans against each other. And what of the Republican Party? They, too, are finishing the Trump presidency the way they started it, with a show of complicity and cowardice.

There are some Republicans, the most repugnant, who are enthusiastically whipping up anger and spreading lies about voter fraud, trying to convince their base that Biden will be an illegitimate usurper. At the other end, there are a few who have grudgingly acknowledged reality, admitting that yes, Biden won the election and will become president in January. But there are so few of the latter group that when one says, “I expect Joe Biden to be the next president of the United States,” it makes the news.

The rest of them are hiding, too craven to even answer that simple question. “We invited every single Republican senator to appear on Meet the Press this morning,” said NBC’s Chuck Todd on Sunday. “They all declined.” The reason was clear: They can’t defend Trump and don’t have the guts to tell the truth about what he’s doing.

So please, let’s not hear anyone praise those few Republicans willing to say that Biden is going to be president and the transition should proceed with some measure of professionalism. That’s nothing to be proud of. What we deserve is to hear Republicans say to Trump, “Stop this right now. You are hurting the country.”

But there are none who will do so. So to them we should say: The leader of your party is pouring poison into our national bloodstream, and if you can’t find the courage to say it’s wrong, don’t ever try to tell us again how patriotic you are.

Over the past four years, I’ve thought often about how just a few days after the 2016 election, President Barack Obama welcomed Trump into the Oval Office. Trump had turned himself from a reality show buffoon into a political figure by becoming the country’s foremost advocate of the racist “birther” lie, accusing Obama of not being a real American, then ran a campaign of fear and hatred to win the presidency.

Yet Obama was polite and gracious. Like every American president who came before him, he knew that what mattered at that moment was not the disgust he surely felt for his successor nor his fear of what the future might bring. What mattered was showing Americans that democracy is about all of us, a shared enterprise we have to work to sustain.

Later, Obama would leave Trump a letter welcoming him to the Oval Office, just as George W. Bush did for him and other presidents had done in the past. Here’s part of what it said:

&gt; We are just temporary occupants of this office. That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions — like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties — that our forebears fought and bled for. Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it’s up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.

No president amasses a perfect record of protecting those democratic institutions and traditions. But at the moment their presidencies ended, every one — even those who left in disgrace — remembered that there are principles and commitments more important than their own petty grievances and wounded egos.

Until now."

 * The 22,000 divided into 38,000,000 infected is 0.057%

The result would, of course, be 'embarrassing'. There's a Trump cult member in this thread who offers his own explanation, that they dropped the suit because of ""lefty bullying"". Them lefties have superpowers. 

As I thought about the matter another explanation came to mind. Perhaps the firm looked at Trump's record of (not) paying bills. The guy is the mother of all deadbeats, and he adds insult.  to injury in that he usually gloats publicly when he defrauds somebody. There is a **very** good chance that they'd never get paid for their efforts, and they couldn't chalk it up to advertising when it gets tossed out of court. There will be a long line in front of them as all and sundry try to collect something when Trump declares bankruptcy number 7. 

Just a couple of examples out of a decades long career as a fraudster. The cities, the cities, 14 of them trying to collect [$1.8 million Trump owes them](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-tab-maga-rallies-jumps-18-million-14-cities-say-president-hasnt-paid-police-1498410) for police services at his 'catch a covid' rallies. Lot's of luck guys. Keep an eye on the weather report from HELL-TV. You'll never know when there might be a cold snap. 

This, of course, pales before the [$25 million penalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_University#:~:text=The%20lawsuits%20centered%20around%20allegations,in%20the%202016%20presidential%20election.) awarded the approximately 7000 students with his fake 'university'. No small change that. Amazingly enough after years of legalities the ex-students **did** get their money.  It wasn't Trump who coughed it up however: 

&gt;The settlement was paid, not by Trump, but by his Las Vegas hotel business partner, billionaire Phil Ruffin. In February 2019, during a meeting of the US House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Congresswoman Jackie Speier suggested ""a Kansan"", later revealed to be Ruffin, had paid $25 million to satisfy Trump's liability in the Trump University judgement. Ruffin admitted to paying Trump $28 million in 2018, but claimed it was for ""back-fees"" related to Trump International Hotel Las Vegas and unrelated to the Trump University case.[84]

""Back fees"" as in ""I have your back Donny"". The list could go on ad on, but I think you get the point. Too bad Trump Cult members can't or won't. 

Does he cheat lawyers as well ? Oh yes, Here, from USA Today, is an article on [SOME of Trump's bill dodges](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/). He has victimized lawyers as well."

Our impeached clown president lost the 2016 election by ~3 million votes.

Trump expects this court to create an even more radical precedent and overturn an election that he lost worse than the one he lost in 2016.

1279,1279,1604689974,"While I didn't vote at all in this election, I imagine these are some of the things that encouraged people to vote for Trump:

* **The economy:** Pre-COVID, the economy was very strong and many people viewed that this was a result of Trump's policies.  Add to that Biden's tax plan and his comments about various fossil fuel industries and people might be concerned about what a Biden administration could bring.
* **Foreign policy:** If you recall, back when Trump was elected in 2016, some people claimed that he would engulf us in nuclear war.  That hasn't happened; to the contrary, our relationship with our adversaries is arguably better than it was under Obama's reign.  Add to that the peace deals brokered in the Middle East and it's easy to see why some people might look forward to another Trump term.
* **Roe vs. Wade:** If a person is anti-abortion, then they most likely view Trump as the candidate that would work towards reversing the landmark Supreme Court case and turn the decision back to the individual states.
* **Urban riots:** The leftist rioters, combined with minimal to no effort by Democratic mayors to rein in the property damage could easily make people concerned about the effects of electing a Democratic president.
* **The so-called ""Progressive"" wing of the Democratic party:** People could be turned off by the socialist agenda of Sander/Warren/etc and be concerned that Biden would be too susceptible to influence by this wing of the party.
* **Possible destruction of the Supreme Court:** Biden's refusal to rule out expanding the membership of the Supreme Court in order to make a nakedly political shift could have caused some people concern.

And please---I know most people here are rabidly anti-Trump, but please don't start arguments about whether you view these points as valid or not.  I'm pointing out reasons that people might vote for Trump, not making any claims about if the reasons would convince you to vote that way."

1282,1282,1604536332,"Trump’s voters voted overwhelmingly in person on Election Day. Those votes were counted quickly.  The vast majority of the absentee ballots were Democrats, since the Dems encouraged that because of COVID. Those votes are being counted now.

1283,1283,1604519773,"Im really not arguing, just playing devils advocate right now. And u did ask for what policies Biden has that ppl would disagree with so I gave some 

As for no.1-  I didn’t say I agree that they’re handouts, but there are some who call them that.  
I don’t think anyone can truly say what amount of money someone needs, so saying that is neither here nor there. . If your boss out of the blue wanted to pay you a million dollars for the same work you’d probably take it without a second thought, I would for sure. And I’d probably try to do some good with it too. And there are def some vulnerable ppl who need help, but help needs to also come with a way to get them to a position where they are non longer vulnerable. This is one thing the US def gets wrong. 

2- as it stands right now, we have a mix of private and public healthcare. The biggest problem is that the public part is still too expensive for a middle class working person or family. heres an example - if you make more than 70,000$ and need a family plan, thru the ACA it will cost you 1,100$ per month. 
And there are govt plans for children, retired and disabled that are free.   
So I really have no idea what Biden could do other than the govt subsidizing even more ppl with a higher subsidy,  can’t run a govt with no money, and we’ve spent trillions for covid so far. 
Yes I know we shouldn’t care about $ over health, but when you run a govt all facets of it need to be taken into consideration. 

3- yes it will take years to fully disband the oil and gas industry but it is still a big concern for states and the ppl in them that work or plan to work in that industry. And Biden certainly can work to put regulations in place that can curtail this industry right now. 
And I don’t believe I pointed fingers at any other country, I stated that the US has a huge reliance on gas powered transportation and that will not change any time soon so we need that industry in this country to supply this country. 

4- the fact remains that the whole Democratic Party are more pro immigration than the other side.  They would be more than happy to expand immigration. 
There are a whole host of problems at our borders, (including separating kids,) but the solution to problems in South American countries cannot be to let anyone who wants to migrate to the US. 
But curiously, where exactly do you think we should be putting thousands of ppl while they wait for asylum hearings?  
Again, the US is not the only country dealing with unwanted migrants, it’s happening around the world and every country is trying to balance helping without being flooded. 
And just as an aside- drugs are prevelant in the US, the war on drugs is a failure, but some states are going the complete opposite way in decriminalizing them.  Oregon just voted to decrim heroin and cocaine. And Denver decrimed psychedelic mushrooms. 
That’s probably not the better plan. In 20 years we’re gonna have a crisis of drug addled adults, who will be those vulnerable ones who will then need to be supported - by the govt. 

So I’m sure we aren’t going to solve any of these problems but at least we can discuss them. 
As for me, whoever wins this election wins. If it’s my guy, great. If not, oh well. I’m not gonna cry scream and yell fraud."

You can tell by the tone of his voice, the way he spoke about things he disagreed with, etc., that all it would have done is started a downward spiral of a dispute where the best resolution would have been a neutral one.

You know how we have our group of sources that we know are total bullshit and so we know to ignore them? They have their opposite list, which lists a bunch of the sources that we trust. But they see them as fake/liars/withholders of the truth/etc.

1294,1294,1604438371,"&gt;Fraud is exceedingly rare in mail-in voting, thanks to a range of security measures — including identity verification, ballot tracking and the efforts of the US Postal Service police force.

&gt;Oregon, the first state to adopt voting exclusively by post, has sent more than 100 million ballots to registered voters since 2000. Only about a dozen cases of proven fraud have been documented in the state, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute in New York City.

&gt;Hill points out that postal ballots use a wide variety of designs and materials, which makes it difficult to duplicate them effectively on a scale that would affect the outcome of an election.

Twelve out of 100 million over 20 years doesn't seem like a large number. That's about 0.6 frauds per year. Of course this is a positive number greater than zero. This is in contrast to Trump's latest lie which has been circulating for some time amongst his cult, that somehow, someway, by a miracle the Covid 19 death count is overestimated because ""doctors make money by listing coronavirus as the cause of death"". Of course how this might happen is **always** left to the imagination, both by Trump and his mindless followers. But as to actual instances the number of cases where this has happened and it can be pointed to are **exactly zero**. This is even less than 12 out of 100 million. 

I'm surprised that the lie machine has taken this long to produce this latest droppings from the hind end of a male bovid. This has been the method since day 1 for giving a *totally* false picture of how many have died in Russia. It has been commented on many times in that country, and in reaction to such exposure the numbers have been *very partially corrected* in a few cases. In the Motherland coroners and even general practitioners have received the 'suggestion' (sic) that if a deceased patient has *any* other disease at the time of death with Covid then that *other* disease should be listed as the cause of death, not Covid. It speaks to the 'density' of the average Trump cultist that it took them months to latch on to this well used way of lying. It speaks even louder to the density of their Fuhrer that he has only discovered this method of lying so late in the game. 

It's a bit of a diversion, but lets give a metaphor to expose how ridiculous this little rhetorical trick is. Of course people with pre-existing conditions will have a higher death rate from Covid 19 - just as they would have from EVERY other disease. The metaphor - suppose you had a group of people who are suffering from quadriplegia. One by one lay them down on a railway track when a train is approaching. The Russian government, Trump's cult and the Loudest Liar himself would have you believe that they all died of quadriplegia. Never the train. No, never, never blame the train. Maybe the doctors ""make money"" by noting that they all died from being run over by a train."

None openly criticize the mass protests, instead they give the ol' ""there's just not enough data"". It's a fact that world wide cases are going up. Crowds gather for a Trump rally, most of which have been outdoors, yet somehow most media outlets completely flip their stance against the very point they used to condone protests in the first place all while disregarding there's a world wide increase.

They found that  the events led to over 30,000 new cases in the country and resulted in over 700 deaths, but recognized that the deaths were “not  necessarily among attendees.” 

 In a statement to The Hill, the Trump campaign deputy national press secretary Courtney Parella said ""Fuck your feelings"" or something like that, who cares.  Everyone knows these morons dont even bother to tell anything even resembling the truth anymore. 

The study results come as public  health experts have warned that the fall and winter seasons could lead  to a disastrous third wave of coronavirus cases as the colder weather  forces people to congregate indoors. 

The  president, however, has repeatedly dismissed the new surge in cases,  claiming that the nation is “rounding the turn” on the pandemic. He has  also blamed the media for the intense focus on COVID-19. 

On Friday, he [drew backlash](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/523740-american-medical-association-rips-trump-claim-that-doctors-are) for claiming that doctors are improperly counting coronavirus deaths for personal and monetary gain. 

Trump  has drawn scrutiny for holding rallies with thousands of mostly  unmasked people despite the pandemic. Supporters at his rallies are also  not seen social distancing. "

1324,1324,1603918219,"&gt; is 5% death high for being 80? what is the flu death rate for someone that age?

The CDC also posts the [fatality rate for influenza](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm). So lets compare the data.

1327,1327,1603915281,"&gt; Do you disagree with that?

The CDC scenario 5 case fatality rate does look a bit rosy when compared to the measured [case fatality rate in the US](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality), and on top of that, you are purposefully leaving out the highest fatality rate.

* 70+ years 5% fatality

In the US alone, there are ~35 million people that are 70+ which means an additional 1-2 million dead if we allow this disease to run through the population uncontrolled.

And the straight fatality rate is misleading. Getting COVID-19 and [""merely"" needing hospitalization](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) (about 5-10% rate) will [cost an arm and a leg](https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/hospitalized-care-covid-19-averages-34662-45683-varying-age) (~$40k easy)."

The reason you're spamming this data is to show that 'Coronavirus isn't really a big deal' and 'reopen the economy' - and you've latched onto Scenario 5 here.

As the BOLD text indicates - the CDC did NOT prepare this data to show the 'impact of Covid.' They explain right at the top of the site the motivation:

&gt;CDC and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Responseexternal icon (ASPR) have developed five COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios that are designed to help inform decisions by public health officials who use mathematical modeling, and by mathematical modelers throughout the federal government.  Models developed using the data provided in the planning scenario tables can help evaluate the potential effects of different community mitigation strategies (e.g., social distancing).  The planning scenarios may also be useful to hospital administrators in assessing resource needs and can be used in conjunction with the COVID-19Surge Tool.

So - basically - they're trying to make the case for the best and worst outcomes depending on the level of preparedness and caution the government / society takes.

If you're saying - fuck it, I don't think we should do anything to mitigate this pandemic, you're advocating for their worst case scenario: 4.

And if you are cool with killing that many folks, go ahead and make that argument in good faith, instead of this bullshit you're trying now (Look guys - here's where we are today - with SOME level of shutdown/masks/caution. CDC is saying we're safe! Let's open up!)"

After all, it was a significant part of the focus of talks by our public and MPs in Leaving the EU (which, btw, was supported more by right-wing and right-leaning candidates and the public than those either in the centre or on the left). I know that in the US, the NHS is often talked about negatively, and I frequently have to talk about the truths and untruths that are told. Don’t get me wrong, everyone knows it’s not perfect.

I also think that it is wrongly assumed that the UK is not socialist, when it is in fact a lot more socialist than many people (especially Americans) believe. I’m not saying we are a democratic-socialist nation, but the UK is much closer to Democratic-Socialism than it is towards a strong capitalist approach. Our higher education represents this, along with our transportation sectors, and our social welfare system. Even our politics reflects this, with our current Conservative Government, although one of the most right-leaning Governments in recent years, has a very strong socialist approach (it’s currently doing a lot of nationalising, which has increased support. This started before the COVID-19 pandemic). 

Yes, Romania had its problems, but so did a lot of former USSR-aligned states. The United States, however, has experienced democratic socialism in its past, it’s just not heavily talked about, and it was at a time where other things took precedence. The video is about “Democratic” socialism, and not just socialism. There is no way that you can equate Romania’s situation in the 1980s to today’s society - it was, after all, 40 years ago. I have also experienced the negative effects of socialism and communism; after all, my father is from Poland. The video is extremely inaccurate, and it has a clear bias. That’s all I have to say"

While President Trump's chief of staff on Monday attempted to clarify  the assertion that the United States is “not going to control” the [coronavirus crisis](https://news.yahoo.com/coronavirus), the president himself complained that the media is too focused on a pandemic that [has killed more than 225,000 Americans and infected more than 8.6 million](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

Trump said news coverage of COVID-19, which he has described as an  attempt to hurt his campaign, should be “an election law violation.”

In [an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday](https://www.yahoo.com/news/jake-tapper-mark-meadows-pence-coronavirus-control-143125422.html),  Mark Meadows, Trump's chief of staff, sought to defend the  administration's response to the virus on a weekend in which the United  States saw its [highest ever number of new COVID-19 cases in a two-day span](https://news.yahoo.com/u-sees-highest-number-covid-181400573.html).

“We’re  not going to control the pandemic,” Meadows said. “We are going to  control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics and other  mitigations.”  

“Why aren’t we going to get control of the pandemic?” [Tapper asked](https://twitter.com/CNNSotu/status/1320360894182862850).

“Because it is a contagious virus,” Meadows replied.

Later Sunday, the Biden campaign released a statement seizing on the interview.

“This  wasn’t a slip by Meadows,” the campaign said. “It was a candid  acknowledgement of what President Trump’s strategy has clearly been from  the beginning of this crisis: to wave the white flag of defeat and hope  that by ignoring it, the virus would simply go away.”

 

Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Monday, Meadows  elaborated on his comments. “We’re going to defeat the virus; we’re not  going to control it,” he said. “We will try to contain it as best we  can, but if you look at the full context of what I was talking about, we  need to make sure that we have therapeutics and vaccines, we may need  to make sure that when people get sick that, that they have the kind of  therapies that the president of the United States had. Then we can  provide those emergency using authorizations. Hopefully they’ll be  coming in very short order.”

When asked whether his remarks  amounted to the White House waving a “white flag” in its coronavirus  fight, Meadows said, “The only person waving a white flag, along with  his white mask, is Joe Biden,” who unlike Trump appears in public with  his nose and mouth covered.

Trump, meanwhile, appeared focused on  the media’s coverage of the coronavirus, claiming the press is using the  pandemic to damage his reelection chances.

“We have made tremendous progress with the China Virus, but the Fake News refuses to talk about it this close to the Election,” [the president tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1320690788628598784).  “COVID, COVID, COVID is being used by them, in total coordination, in  order to change our great early election numbers. Should be an election  law violation!”

“The Fake News Media is riding COVID, COVID, COVID, all the way to the Election,” [he added](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1320711322284281862?s=21). “Losers!”

Then,  after arriving in Pennsylvania for the first of three rallies, Trump  said it was asked to respond Biden’s “white flag” statement.

“He’s waved the white flag on life,” Trump said. “He doesn’t leave his basement.”

“He’s a pathetic candidate,” the president added. “We’re absolutely rounding the corner.”"

That is what people who have worked in counterterrorism have been trying to tell Trump for several years, but he hasn’t been willing to listen. Former Trump DHS officials Miles Taylor and Elizabeth Neumann have been saying this publicly over the last several months. And the latest DHS report, released earlier this month, says it, too:

“Among DVEs [domestic violence extremists], racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists—specifically white supremacist extremists (WSEs)—will remain the most persistent and lethal threat in the Homeland. Spikes in other DVE threats probably will depend on political or social issues that often mobilize other ideological actors to violence, such as immigration, environmental, and police-related policy issues.

• WSEs have demonstrated longstanding intent to target racial and religious minorities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, politicians, and those they believe promote multi-culturalism and globalization at the expense of the WSE identity. Since 2018, they have conducted more lethal attacks in the United States than any other DVE movement.”

This is a quote from page 18 of the Oct 2020 Homeland Threat Assessment Report.

Page 19:

“We also remain particularly concerned
about the impacts from COVID-19 where anti-government and anti-authority violent extremists could be motivated to conduct attacks in response to perceived infringement of liberties and government overreach as all levels of government seek to limit the spread of the coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic.

• Ideologies driven by such DVE’s often are reinforced by a variety of online content, including conspiracy theories and political commentary they view as controversial. Current events that DVEs perceive as infringing on their worldviews often contribute to periods of increased ideologically motivated violence, including recently during the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide lawful protests.”

The experts said no masks, then masks, then no masks, lock down good, lockdown bad, stay home, go riot, dont go to trump rallies, do burn cities down.

&gt;Trump’s campaign owes 14 cities across the nation some $1.82 million in unpaid bills for MAGA rallies stretching back to 2016, according to a report earlier this year from the nonprofit news operation Center for Public Integrity and NBC.

&gt;Local officials have complained that the Trump campaign’s unpaid bills are an especially difficult burden now as they grapple with the extra cost of battling COVID-19 as well as aiding residents suffering financial hardships due to the pandemic.

Let's see. $80,000 plus $50,000 equals $130,000 that this lifelong deadbeat will have stung Tucson residents for when his little threat to public health goes through. This pales before the $1.82 MILLION still owed to various cities from 4 years ago. 

Don the Don has a decades-long record of not paying his bills, and his collective creditors probably number in the thousands by now. Besides having conned many more people for greater sums there is one outstanding difference between him and the ordinary fraudster serving time in prison. An ordinary decent criminal merely goes through his act in order to get money. Donnie Boy has a psychological quirk to his thefts. It isn't just the money. It is also, and especially, his life-long insecurity that makes him take great pleasure in *getting one over on the other guy*, the ""winning"" that he is so obsessed with. This sadistic pleasure means that the amount may be less important than it would be to a normal person. For all I know he may take as much pleasure in sharking a contractor for $10,000 as in defrauding the American taxpayers for a million. That empty hole in his soul can never be filled in and satisfied. 

The following scenario would be *interesting* even if not possible. While Tucson rolls out its police force in the hundreds to provide security for the Thief-in-Chief there should be a special squad, numerous enough to intimidate the Secret Service guards. 30, 40, 50, whatever it takes. Walk onto the stage and present the crook with a 'pay now' demand and summons to a local court. The problem resides not in the Secret Service who are just doing their jobs but rather in the fact that there will be many, many heavily armed terrorist fans of Mussolini-light in the crowd.

Any pandemic management strategy relying upon immunity from natural  infections for COVID-19 is flawed. Uncontrolled transmission in younger  people risks significant morbidity(3) and  mortality across the whole population. In addition to the human cost,  this would impact the workforce as a whole and overwhelm the ability of  healthcare systems to provide acute and routine care.

Furthermore, there is no evidence for lasting protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 following natural infection(4)  and the endemic transmission that would be the consequence of waning  immunity would present a risk to vulnerable populations for the  indefinite future. Such a strategy would not end the COVID-19 pandemic  but result in recurrent epidemics, as was the case with numerous  infectious diseases before the advent of vaccination. It would also  place an unacceptable burden on the economy and healthcare workers, many  of whom have died from COVID-19 or experienced trauma as a result of  having to practise disaster medicine. Additionally, we still do not  understand who might suffer from long term symptoms of COVID infection.  Defining who is vulnerable is complex, but even if we consider those at  risk of severe illness, the proportion of vulnerable people constitute  as much as 30% of the population in some regions(8).  Prolonged isolation of large swathes of the population is practically  impossible and highly unethical. Empirical evidence from many countries  shows that it is not feasible to restrict uncontrolled outbreaks to  particular sections of society. Such an approach also risks further  exacerbating the socioeconomic inequities and structural discriminations  already laid bare by the pandemic. Special efforts to protect the most  vulnerable are essential but must go hand-in-hand with multi-pronged  population-level strategies."

The early voting is trending heavily Democratic, which is the opposite of what it normally is (which is why often the Republican candidates start so far ahead in early election returns). Trump has probably contributed to his own downfall as A) Democratic voters rush to mail in ballots &amp; vote early to thwart his efforts to suppress the vote while B) Republicans wait to vote in person because he made them think mail-in voting is risky. Also, these initial long lines for early voting will discourage more Republicans than Democrats who are more motivated by the political opposition than any figure in US history.

When our impeached president says things like Biden ""Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from it. And he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen"" and ""I've never seen a man that likes the mask more"" Trump [is doing a macho spin](https://www.motherjones.com/coronavirus-updates/2020/10/trump-masks-covid-toxic-masculinity/) on mask wearing.

Trump voters believe that Covid-19 is a hoax. Either there is no virus at all or it is less harmful than a mild case of the flu. They also believe that Donald Trump defeated a deadly Covid-19 infection because of his superior genes, formidable physique and his anointment by God. Yes they believe both with equal fervor.

1408,1408,1602171969,"&gt;  are continuing to spread this virus to us all.

Let's consider some **facts**:

* The White House refuses to follow CDC guidelines about the virus. Many people infected at the White House (including Trump and Pence!) *refuse* to self-quarantine.

* The administration lies and has resisted testing. They censored the CDC stating scientific fact that COVID-19 can be airborne transmitted.

* Trump has publicly talked in an interview about herd immunity, an unproven theory but one whose strategy is to do nothing about the virus -- which fits the administration's real-life actions.

You're right. They're deliberately spreading the virus!

Trump has 100% gov't-paid health care at a gov't-run hospital, the best health care in the world. Trump has said he's going to give the experimental drugs he received *free* to the American people -- but there is no funding to do such a thing, only hot air from a president on steroids.

If Trump does not get a bad/lethal case of COVID-19 he's going to scream that the virus is nothing and that we should do nothing, mark my words (he's already doing it!)."
1409,1409,1602170420,"Completely irresponsible behavior -- these people do not care about others. CDC guidelines are that both Pence and his wife should be in quarantine since they were exposed to people infected with COVID-19.

But yet Pence (and Trump) refuses to quarantine or follow the CDC guidelines.

Did anyone else hear Pence breathing at the debate or see is blood-red eye? He did not look or sound healthy."
1410,1410,1602170109,"The White House *refuses* to disclose what medications Trump is on, and it *refuses* to disclose Trump's test results about whether he is infectious and still carrying the virus.

This means Trump is insisting that Biden go into a room without protection when Trump's own doctors suit up in *full* PPE because he has COVID-19.

It's insane! Biden should refuse to debate."
1411,1411,1602167712,"With days to live before covid carries him off, I wouldn't want to debate either. What do you suppose is on the bucket list of a wanna-be dictator?"
1412,1412,1602163730,"I'd like to say i'm shocked by this but yeah, i'm just not. Seriously, the man is contagious and he's acting like he gets a commission for every new case of COVID he directly passes along to someone. I'm glad the debate commission are acting like the adults in the room here because regardless of how you feel, I'd hope we could agree that this is a unique situation that requires steps like these to happen. It's better this virtual debate than no debate at all: [https://magpiebrule.ca/2020/10/08/virtual-insanity/](https://magpiebrule.ca/2020/10/08/virtual-insanity/)"
1413,1413,1602087398,"This! ^^ Do a video debate -- that's a no-brainer.

Let's consider some facts: Either Trump or Biden will be our next president. They're both super-old and we as a country need to protect their health.

Trump already has COVID-19 due to his own moronic actions. We should be ensuring Biden does not get it in case he becomes president. Why, you ask?

Many people who have been impacted by COVID-19 have organ damage weeks or months after they recover. COVID-19 is *not* ""the flu."" (Trump himself admitted this to a reporter but now he lies saying it is like the flu!) It is an unknown disease. Coronaviruses can be more lethal than COVID-19 and we do not know how COVID-19 will ""evolve.""

As such, we should be working to protect *both* Biden and Trump -- and also Pence and Harris. Putting one of these people into a room with a known COVID-19 carrier is just **stupid** and should be avoided."

1) Either faking covid to get sympathy or got covid on purpose and has recklessly infected enough people to cause a superspreader event. Either way, he was informed about this disease almost a year ago, then again in Januray and did nothing to prevent it. When people started dying he told them it was a hoax. Then he told them it was real but would magically disappear. Then he told them to drink bleach. Then he tried to but the German company making a vaccine. Then he created a new government agency staffed with his friends who proceeded to divert medical supplies to Trump supporters and used those supplies as leverage. Then he promised schools money for PPE if they opened in the fall, but then reneged on that promise after they opened and left the schools with a crushing bill they cannot afford. 

2) He committed tax Fraud and only paid $750 in taxes when the rest of the American people are paying three times that and we do not live in mansions and have servants.

3) He has paid off/ strong-armed numerous women to prevent rape allegations from hitting the news.

4) He cheated on his college exams.

5) He insulted Veterans that fought and died for this country.

6) He incited riots and violence in cities across the country.

7) He sent a clear call to white supremacy groups using public media that is paid for by US taxpayers.

8) He instructed his staff and supporters to be sympathetic to the white supremacist shooter that killed an unarmed man.

9) He stole funds meant for 911 survivors and moved them to a department that he needed loyalty from.

10) He nominated a replacement for RBG before she had even been laid to rest, disregarding and dishonoring her last wish that the next elected President be the one to make that nomination."

If you knew what he did you'd already be so livid that this wouldn't even matter though. Trump's entire COVID-19 response wasn't just catastrophic. It was a literal racketeering scam.

I'm not going out to buy stuff because of covid. People can whine and complain all they want but its not changing anything. The government is providing me safety so I'll stay home and not get sick.

* Biden by 1pt (45 to 44) from Fox News (!) way back on June 25th (when Texas was spiking bad).

I'd say that it looks like the Biden campaign is awaiting more polls, especially those taken over the weekend after Trump got COVID, to plan their next steps. If the debate &amp; coronavirus have improved him enough, he might actually spend more money plus make a campaign stop or two. 

No matter what, it's win-win-win for Biden

* Win - it forces Trump &amp; the RNC to spend more money in Texas, money not spent elsewhere like Penn. which is now 49 - 42 for Biden.

&gt; Now that President Trump and first lady Melania have tested positive for COVID-19, Trumpworld has discovered the value of empathy.

&gt; On Trump&amp;#039;s favorite show, &amp;quot;Fox and Friends,&amp;quot; on Friday morning, the conservative Washington Examiner correspondent writer Byron York said, &amp;quot;This is a time for people to pray for their leaders, to wish them well,&amp;quot; adding that the Trump critics snarking over his illness would likely come to regret being so mean to the president.

&gt; While Shapiro has been cagey in his support for Trump - distinguishing himself from &amp;quot;Never Trump&amp;quot; by calling himself &amp;quot;Sometimes Trump&amp;quot; - he&amp;#039;s demonstrated a Trumpian comfortability for mocking the ill, such as when he joked in 2016 that then Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who was sick with pneumonia, &amp;quot;Should pledge to defeat ISIS by coughing on them.""

1458,1458,1601668798,"You are assuming things, Trump is not my president, I'm not a citizen yet, I was going to receive my citizenship this year, but COVID hit."
1459,1459,1601665399,I agree. I was told I had no empathy when it comes to him. He reacted the same to me when my sister and mother contracted covid-19 and my mother died of it. Could not of happened to a shittier person.
1460,1460,1601663280,"You never know, he could wind up taking out the entire Republican leadership via Covid."
1461,1461,1601657672,I can understand why you would assume that but swine can contract COVID too you know.
1462,1462,1601657597,"I think this is a real possibility. Not probable but we know that they will do anything to win. He may be trying to energize the covid denier community to get them to vote. He comes out in a week and say ""LOOK! COVIDS WEAK JUST AS I SAID! YOU'RE RIGHT AND ALL THE COVID FEARERS ARE WRONG. I'M SUPERMAN! COME OUT AND VOTE!"" or something assinine like that."
1463,1463,1601655332,"That might be the social norm as a standard but there's not a law obligating him to do so.  I guarantee you that if he wants to go somewhere and hold a rally right now he will.  It is already well established that his supporters don't give a fuck about distancing or quarantines.  
  
And he's already getting special exemptions to local/state laws on gathering sizes when he holds them.  
  
And to be perfectly honest, I'm not even convinced (yet) that he actually has it.  Given how much this guy lies, and how unethical he is, I wouldn't put it past him to have done this whole thing as a stunt where he can later claim it was a 24 or 48 hour flu, or even less, in order to try and minimize COVID.  And more than his lies, do you know why I most disbelieve it?  
  
Because the positives were him and Melania.  Most people are physically close to their wives, but he is not.  They don't even sleep in the same room.  They barely communicate, they don't touch at all outside of public, they're rarely in the same room.  He is however in constant physical contact with 3 of his 5 kids (and one of them close physical contact), and they haven't gotten it.  
  
To the normal outside it looks like a husband/wife getting sick together because they live together, and adult children that live away being slightly more distant.  But that's not how their family is organized.  As such, I'm hesitant to believe they actually have it so far."
1464,1464,1601654895,no he can't. You get covid-19 you self quarantine for 14 days. No ifs ands or buts about it. That is the standard. Everyone does it. You don't do that then you don't give a fuck about anyone else. So unless he wants to look even worse than he already does he will self quarantine for 14 days.
1465,1465,1601653029,i would never wish Covid on any one but I won't be sending a get well card
1466,1466,1601648973,"Give it time. There are hundreds of people cooking and cleaning in the WH. Are they all in protective gear from handling items from tump? Cleaning and washing dishes etc? are the trumps wearing masks to protect the workers? There is more to this story, it just hasnt played out yet I have not seen a single medical expert (one that is not a tump puppet) come forward to say there was a positive test result.

Kids in college are actually buying negative results and people have been caught falsifying a positive result to get out of work.  I think trump was feeling a bit sick and tired because he is old and he spun it into a PR stunt.

 However, If Trump is not faking, then he and his wife are directly   responsible for infecting and possibly killing thousands of people. In   fact, if he knew his team was positive when they attended the debate,   this could be a bio-terror act to specifically infect Biden and his   team. There are laws against most chemical agents, but no laws against   harming people with covid."
1467,1467,1601648390,"&gt; It is what it is. (What Trump said about Americans who died from COVID)

He's not wrong, but it's a shitty and insensitive thing to say. They would have died regardless of whom was in the Whitehouse at the time. Just like people would be railing against wearing masks regardless of who was in power. It's just yet another ""un-Presidential"" thing he's said because he's not very Presidential.

They weren't ""kidnapped"" either. Their parents were here unlawfully. I think we should fast track the deportations back to where they came from, no need to house them then."

This is no different from the Somalian government stealing food sent by the United Nations and cartels selling it illegally. [(11)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/10/aid-somalia-stolen-un-report)

Except in this situation FEMA is the cartels and the banana republic is the United States.

Also regarding Trump removing the watchdog overseeing the $2 trillion coronavirus bill? In 1998 the Supreme Court ruled line item vetos are unconstitutional. [(12)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_v._City_of_New_York)

His excuse? The Take Care Clause. And the Take Care Clause just says the President can't make his underlings do stuff that's against the law. It underscores that the executive is under a duty to faithfully execute the laws of Congress and not disregard them. [(13)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution)

If you don't know what that's about, Trump wrote a signing statement (basically functionally a line item veto except the next President could undo it, but by then it'd be too late) into the stimulus bill that he was going to ignore the oversight provisions in the bill and do it himself. [(14)](https://www.motherjones.com/coronavirus-updates/2020/03/trump-says-hell-ignore-key-oversight-provision-in-stimulus-bill-1/) Either way, the Take Care Clause makes it illegal. 

According to Bradley and Posner, since the president is actually obligated under the “Take Care Clause” to comply with the constitution, “if the president believes that a statute violates the constitution, he has a constitutional obligation not to enforce it” (Bradley and Posner: 358).[(16)](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1411&amp;context=etd) The opposite also holds true (see citation 13).

I spent over 300 mornings in the Oval Office briefing the president and his senior staff. I had the privilege to manage, edit and deliver the president’s Daily Brief a summary of the most timely and critical intelligence threats to the U.S. from 2010 to 2014.

As a Deputy on the National Security Council, I spent over 1,000 hours in the White House Situation Room providing the intelligence assessments which informed critical U.S. national security policy decisions — including the raid that rendered justice for the victims of 9/11.

Since I have been eligible to vote, I have never registered with a political party. I remain an independent with a history of voting for candidates I believe in — I focused on their policy and not their party. Before this election, I have never spoken out for or against a candidate for any office.

But I can be silent no longer.

In the summer of 1976, I was 14 years old and new to Colorado, my father took command of the Western Region’s National Guard. I enrolled in the brand-new Smoky Hill High School on what was then the far eastern boundary of Aurora. As a military brat, I was accustomed to moving around and not putting down roots — but as readers will know well, Colorado has a way of pulling on your heart and it became home. It remains so as my family spends as much time as possible in our Dillon residence.

Upon graduating from Cornell University, I joined the intelligence community as an analyst during President Ronald Reagan’s increasing investments in defense — a buildup that culminated in the collapse of the Soviet Union by the end of the decade. In my nearly four decades of service, I had the privilege of serving under six presidents — four Republican and two Democrat. The constant across all of those administrations was the oath I took to “protect and defend” the Constitution against “all enemies — foreign and domestic.”

I know what it takes to succeed at the highest levels of our government — intellectual curiosity, the strength of moral purpose and a commitment to selfless service. Broadly speaking, I can personally attest that Americans were very well served by those they elected to fill critical national security positions.

There is one important exception to that statement — our current president.

I have briefed him up close — and I have seen and felt the effect of his faults on our nation’s security.  Out of respect for the confidential nature of Oval Office conversations, I will not provide details. Suffice to say that the person you see presiding over COVID-19 press conferences is the same one in the privacy of his office. He has little patience for facts or data that do not comport with his personal world view. Thus, the conversations are erratic and less than fully thoughtful.

While it is natural for there to be tension between the intelligence community and senior policymakers, President Donald Trump’s decision to rely upon the word of dictators like Vladimir Putin is an unprecedented betrayal of his oath to the Constitution. Our current president bases his decisions on his instincts, and his instincts are based upon a personal value proposition — what’s in it for me?

As a Commander in Chief, President Trump comes up tragically short. He fails to protect our soldiers when bounties are placed on their heads by his friend Vladimir. And not only does he not respect their service, but President Trump also belittles combat heroes who were taken as prisoners of war.

As a nation, we were fortunate that a true crisis did not occur during his first three years in office.

Then 2020 happened. This has been an unprecedented year for which many of us were not prepared. In moments of crisis, the American people demand — and deserve — a leader who will put the country first. Full stop. Because the reality and the science of COVID-19 conflicted with his personal views, President Trump knowingly downplayed the pandemic.

This is not about the economy, taxes, health care or any other normal ballot considerations. This is about American lives unnecessarily lost. This is about businesses unnecessarily closed. This is about being guided by service to all Americans. This is about centering decisions on a higher morality. President Trump’s actions — and inaction — demonstrates that he is not concerned about any of this.

And as damaging as his faulty leadership has been, four more years would be devastating.

We must elect a thoughtful, moral, responsible, respectful leader on Nov. 3. Our current president is not that leader."
1499,1499,1601047051,"Here is the full text of the op-ed:

Lately I’ve found myself thinking about Trofim Lysenko.

Who? Lysenko was a Soviet agronomist who decided that modern genetics was all wrong, indeed contrary to Marxist-Leninist principles. He even denied that genes existed, while insisting that long-discredited views about evolution were actually right. Real scientists marveled at his ignorance.

But Joseph Stalin liked him, so Lysenko’s views became official doctrine, and scientists who refused to endorse them were sent to labor camps or executed. Lysenkoism became the basis for much of the Soviet Union’s agricultural policy, eventually contributing to the disastrous famines of the 1930s.

Does all of this sound a bit familiar given recent events in America?

Those worried about a crisis of democracy in the United States — which means everyone paying attention — usually compare Donald Trump to strongmen like Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, not Stalin. Indeed, if the G.O.P. has become an extremist, anti-democratic party — and it has — it’s an extremism of the right.

But while nobody would accuse Trump of being a leftist, his political style always reminds me of Stalinism. Like Stalin, he sees vast, implausible conspiracies everywhere — anarchists somehow in control of major cities, radical leftists somehow controlling Joe Biden, secret anti-Trump cabals throughout the federal government. It’s also notable that those who work for Trump, like Stalinist officials, consistently end up being cast out and vilified — although not sent to gulags, at least not yet.

And Trumpism, like Stalinism, seems to inspire special disdain for expertise and a fondness for quacks.

On Wednesday Trump said two things that both, if you ask me, deserved banner headlines. Most alarmingly, he refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power if he loses the election.

But he also indicated that he might reject new guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration for approving a coronavirus vaccine, saying that the announcement of these guidelines “sounds like a political move.” What?

OK, we all understand what’s going on here. Many observers worry that the Trump team, in an effort to influence the election, will announce that we have a safe, effective vaccine against the coronavirus ready to go, even if we don’t (and we almost certainly won’t have one that soon). So the Food and Drug Administration was trying to reassure the public about the integrity of its approval process.

And we really need that reassurance, because the Trump administration has given us every reason to distrust statements coming from public health agencies.

Last month the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance to the effect that people exposed to the coronavirus but not having Covid-19 symptoms didn’t need to get tested — contrary to the recommendations of just about every independent epidemiologist. Subsequent reporting revealed that the new guidance was prepared by political appointees and skipped the scientific review process.

More recently, the C.D.C. warned about airborne transmission of the coronavirus — this time matching what experts are saying — only to suddenly pull the guidance from its website a few days later. We don’t know exactly what happened, but it’s hard not to notice that the retracted guidance would have made it clear that recent Trump rallies, which involve large indoor crowds with few people wearing masks, create major public health risks.

So the F.D.A. was trying to assure us that it won’t be corrupted by politics the way the C.D.C. apparently has been. And Trump basically cut the agency off at the knees; his assertion that the new guidelines sound political actually meant that they weren’t political enough, that he wants to keep open the possibility of announcing a vaccine as a way to help retain power.

But if political hacks are calling the shots at the C.D.C., and the F.D.A. is being told to shut up and follow the party line, who’s advising Trump on pandemic policy? Send in the quacks.

Trump’s disastrous push, back in April, for early reopening was reportedly influenced by the writings of Richard Epstein, a law professor who somehow decided that he was an expert in epidemiology and that Covid-19 would kill no more than 500 people, a number he eventually increased to 5,000 — roughly the death toll we’re currently experiencing every week.

But the quack of the moment is Dr. Scott Atlas, a radiologist with no expertise in infectious diseases who nonetheless impressed Trump with his appearances on Fox News. Atlas’s opposition to mask requirements and advocacy of just letting the coronavirus spread until we’ve reached “herd immunity” are very much at odds with what actual epidemiologists are saying, but they’re what Trump wants to hear, and Atlas has apparently become a key adviser on pandemic policy.

That’s what had me thinking about Trofim Lysenko. Like Stalin, Trump denigrates and bullies experts and takes advice on what should be scientific issues from people who don’t know what they’re talking about but tell him what he wants to hear.

And you know what happens when a national leader does that? People die."

""If conservatives become convinced that they cannot win democratically, they will not abandon conservatism. They will reject democracy"" - David Frum

They've been rejecting Democracy for a few decades now. Gerrymandering, voter suppression, voter roll purges, outright election rigging, and more. And the electoral college plays right to their favor since it can make a vote in a super rural area worth like 5 times as much as a highly urban one. It's why Clinton and Gore lost despite winning the popular vote.

Outright denying Obama a Supreme Court nomination then stealing it, denying Obama judge nominations of any kind then ramming through their own once they were in power. Outright rejecting to even bring up thousands of bills the House passes for a vote. Refusing to even hold a proper impeachment hearing. Now trying to destroy the post office. It's a direct subversion of democracy.

It should be obvious that this is a full on coup and has been in plain sight for decades.

As Democrats we're too naive and expect people to make actions in good faith. But we aren't dealing with people that act in good faith. We're dealing with corrupt sociopathic ratfucking bastards out for themselves that have rejected democracy and the very core of America itself.

-	**signature matching** done by untrained ballot counters. Signatures change over time, especially for younger voters, who tend to vote blue. Signatures by the disabled or elderly also change as dexterity declines or changes over time (try to sign your name with shaking hands, it comes out different every time). 
-	**exact name matches** which primarily invalidate ballots with “ethnic sounding” names - primarily belonging to POC and immigrant populations. Names get written down wrong and when data is transcribed it can be wrongly changed to someone inaccurate, invalidating votes. This is a huge issue impacting minority communities. 
-	**voter ID laws** which require you buy an ID and go drive to get photographed and pick it up or have it mailed to your address if your state allows. This impacts low income people the most, people without stable addresses (often poorer people again, some of whole are homeless or crashing at friends houses), people without reliable transportation (again, the poor), rural people and others lacking public transportation, and people who can’t take off work to get their ID (low income workers who are hourly and can’t afford to skip shifts if they miraculously get time off approved). Oh, and to get the ID you need to have other forms of identification already, all of which cost money (poor people again), and most impacts the young, elderly, rural, and transient/homeless, who may have never gotten an ID before or lost theirs. You can use things like bills in your name to your address, but you have to have bills to pay, which many don’t or can’t afford. 
-	**witness laws** for absentee voting, which most impacts those who live alone (especially during covid, that’s a big problem), rural areas (hard to vote in person because of distance to polling location), older folks (covid dangers, standing in line for hours in the heat or cold at polling location is hard on body), and then all of the above laws also apply to the witness so it’s double the issue
-	**confusing ballots** especially for mail in ballots. some states make difficult to understand ballots, people don’t sign them because it says “for official use only” in signature area and they think the ballot counter signs that since you never sign a vote cast in person (the ballot itself is anonymous in person), some signature areas are on the back and the ballot is on the front but people don’t flip it over to the back, some require you sign the envelope too, some require a stamp apparently (I’m not sure of the stamp issue), different mail in deadlines (some are nov 3, some well before, and people often don’t realize so they put it in mail on nov 3 and it’s too late), and some people try to vote in person after receiving a mail in ballot but they don’t bring it to the polls to relinquish it as necessary to cast a ballot, so they can’t vote."

Yes, back on August 14th, 2019 he was at 54% disapproval and then for the latest poll of August 12th, 2020 he is at 55% disapproval. But in between was the biggest rollercoaster of approval/disapproval of his entire presidency. It contained the only time he has EVER had approval ratings higher than disapproval ones, a bump from the first weeks of COVID when he pretended to look ""presidential"" and the country rallied around its president as usual. 

But then came the ""COVID drop,"" as his incompetency became harder and harder to cover up or spin. It reached a low of 57% disappoval vs 38% approval for the entire month of June as cases &amp; deaths skyrocketed because of GOP governors making terrible decisions trying to please Trump.

 While his re-election poll numbers haven't seen any improvement over the last month (not even from the traditional ""convention bump""), his approval/disapproval have *slightly* gotten better (57 to 55% disapprove and 38 to 42% approve).

Further, trump is wishy washy flip flopping on how he will accomplish this - it looks *weak*, and shows he doesn’t understand where social security funding comes from and how much that money means to the quality of an average American’s golden years. Should Americans who have paid into the system their entire lives have that entitlement stolen out from under their feet? No! They worked hard for that money, they paid that money into the system on an promise that our government would keep to their word, we all earned that government entitlement fair and square. It is criminal to take that away from hardworking Americans who have spent their whole lives keeping their word to pay taxes on that American promise of social security. We paid government taxes on *every paycheck* with the promise that we would get it back when we were older. To rip it away would be a final sign that everyone who distrusts the government is right, that the government is run - currently run - by con men and crooks who have no concept of what it means to keep their word or live an honest life of a hardworking American. It proves the people elected to drain the swamp are draining *our* tax dollars out of *our* promised entitlements and ensuring our elders are left to rot. American citizens don’t deserve that after all they’ve given this country. *America* is better than that. *America* keeps its promises to American citizens, it doesn’t defraud them of their money for a lifetime. That money *belongs to us, the American people* - it isn’t the government’s money to decide to keep/hoard. (Targeted at Republicans and older people, but any super “patriotic” or rah rah American exceptionalism person should be reachable this way. And anyone who hates paying taxes should get pretty riled up about every cent they handed over to the government that the government intends to keep instead of pay out as promised).

I wouldn’t be above yanking down my mask for 30 seconds while on camera so they get a full view of my face. 
-	turning in ballot early **ensures you have plenty of time to respond and fix any problems invalidating your ballot**, like signature mismatch. Signatures aren’t verified as matches by professionals, they have no idea what they’re doing, and the voters most impacted by this are minorities and young people. **Sign up with BallotTrax app/site and update your email and address on your states Secretary of State** so you receive any correspondence indicating your ballot is at risk of invalidation.
-	Using an absentee ballot **shortens polling station lines** for those who *need* to vote in person, like people who didn’t get their ballot in time to send it back before the deadline. 
-	Dropping it off at a secure drop box **takes USPS and any delays out of the equation**, ensuring your ballot arrives on time
-	turning in your ballot early **allows votes to be tallied up prior to nov 3rd** in some states, freeing up ballot verifiers/counters so they can deal with the crush of votes on nov 3rd. 
-	turning in ballot early to ballot box or VERY early by mail will also help ensure that votes received before ballot return deadline but counted *after* nov 3rd still “count” and **trump can’t call them fraudulent/invalidate them.**

1565,1565,1598862248,"I think you made a lot of great points. 

The best of which, is that the negative outweighs the positive here. The possibilities of different chains of events with another President these last 4 years would be too many to count. The least of these possibilities is because some other person with no political experience would run for the office.

I will not speculate on all the good/bad things that could've happened if the 2016 election was actually determined by how many people voted for which candidate. I will say that just because someone did a good job in some ways, does not mean the same job cannot be done better.


In all the ways listed that could be viewed as surprisingly positive and in favor of/approval of Trump; those could be applied to any candidate, especially Joe Biden.

Biden was a Vice President for 8 years and served in Congress. Trump has had a long career as a businessman, even if it was built on lies and relationships with many people who are now dead/convicted or awaiting trial. I mention their experience to set up a statement: Trump would likely not approve of Biden's approach to business, as it very well could conflict with his own experience and choices. As well as the inverse, Joe Biden would likely not agree with Trump's handling of Political discourse and the responsibilities of the office of The President.

As an American who is old just old enough to remember the Clinton presidency, there has been a political war in this country that mutated as soon as Trump tweeted about Obama's birth certificate. That's your ""Franz Ferdinand Moment"". That is the instant Trump started his political career, as a lying clown.

The problem comes down to why a significant portion of the American public would support a 70 year old man who is golfing for his near 300th time in 4 years and living on Twitter promoting/retweeting and authoring Hate Speech and Slander. Why elect someone who said "" I can walk down onto 5th Ave. and shoot someone, and I will still be elected "" ? Someone who has literally defrauded millions of Americans and global citizens, including the ""Trump University"" Scam? How could the Republican Party of The Unites States support and endorse a candidate who does not stand for American ideals let alone any Conservative values?

I see a problem with people in America and around the world still blind to the fact that The United States has never been closer and similar to 1940's Germany, even considering at that era there were internment camps in America.

People latching onto extreme nationalism as military budgets and police budgets constantly rise. Fear is spread by all political angles and the whole of Government ""shuts down"", events are spun by both sides.

Remember the Political War? Democrats having Clinton in office for 8 years was a ""battle won, but not the war"" so to speak. 8 years of Bush after Clinton? That was retribution. Full stop.

The Clinton's and the Bush families both had gained/already had questionable dealings in their personal/business/political lives. During this time everything was steeped in political drama and the deviciveness came to a head.

When Obama became The First Black President of The United States of America, there was a visible change to the whole country and to the world. Not only did a black man become president, a distinguished politician who was one of the best orators of this Century became the representative to the world for America.

Disagree with his policies all you want, there was nothing un-presidential about Barrack Obama. The only attacks mounted against him were the most baseless accusations, shallow and pedantic attacks of character as well as the usual political banter "" Dems gonna take all your money through raising taxes, Dems gonna come take all your guns, Dems gonna let all the bad boys out of jail and your daughters won't be safe"" the same stuff that republicans and their news outlets have been spouting for years.

Before any economists find this post I should mention that the wealth gap in America is growing  and because of the pandemic, many responsible people have now had years of hard work and saving thrown away because of the prolonging of the spread of the virus. There is no denying the massive economic damage done to The United States because of a refusal to respond to or accept the existence of COVID-19 starting from the top down and supported by blind followers.

My heart goes out to the 180,000+ people who are CURRENTLY reported to have died from this virus in America alone. I know quite a few who have lost a loved one from this virus and the only official person on the Republican side who seems to acknowledge the deaths in any way, was a ""Green German Military Suit"" wearing 2nd lady. Melania an immigrant, and Trump has said ""go back to your sh*thole country"" to American Citizens before, but his wife doesn't count....also Mexicans coming across the border to have ""anchor babies"" according to Fox News about 10 years ago, but Trump's kids are not...interesting, it would seem there's almost NOTHING he has not completely contradicted himself on. 

I've heard the saying ""even if you polish a turd, it's  still a turd"" well bronzer doesn't cover up the smell of crap even if it barely served a positive end, like masking the odor of the carcass of American Democracy.

We don't praise Hitler for what he did well for Germany, because of all the bad he accomplished along the way. There is assuredly a portion of my ancestors that are gone because of one Extreme Nationalist rising to power and gaining a massive following. This situation in America is about preserving democracy for The United States or preventing what would be an ironic twist, a 'necessary invasion of America' to bring back democracy and put a stop to the indecent treatment of human beings at the hands of American citizens, The United States Government and Police Forces across the country. The number of people in America that openly support anti-American values portrayed by Trump and people who align on a certain side of the political spectrum, yet support something far beyond the definition of a trustworthy and truly representative elected official. Conservative Values and Republican Ideals have been shattered by one man, the country is more divided than ever in my lifetime and the people in America have never had more reasons to be demanding more from ALL elected officials.

The last four years aside, the future of the American Government is in the balance. These are in some ways, unprecedented times to be alive.

1581,1581,1598282202,"Right wing drivel using the Constitution, freedom and liberty to oppose common sense public health measures.

The entire article uses the false comparison to the 1918 Spanish flu (which many think actually started in the US).

The differences between the Spanish flu and COVID-19 are many. COVID-19 is much more lethal, for example. The world is more interconnected with people traveling **much** more in 2020 than in 1918 and today we're much more urbanized compared to rural. COVID-19 transmits between people *much* easier than the Spanish flu and COVID-19 has an asymptomatic period where people spread it without even knowing they're sick -- critical differences.

COVID-19 *broke the US/NYC hospital system.* Hospitals in the Bronx in NYC were turning away sick people because their ICUs and beds were overflowing. The NYC mayor noted that 200-300 people were dying at home at one stretch.

For this deceptive article to build a ""straw man argument"" using the 1918 Spanish flu is despicable. Avoid reading that POS article."
1582,1582,1598208606,"&gt;On  the eve of the Republican National Convention where President Trump  hopes to revive his flagging political fortunes, he will announce the  emergency authorization of convalescent plasma for covid-19, a treatment  that already has been given to more than 70,000 patients, according to  officials familiar with the decision.  
&gt;  
&gt;In  a tweet late Saturday night, White House press secretary Kayleigh  McEnany said the announcement at 5:30 p.m. Sunday involved “a major  therapeutic breakthrough on the China virus.” Officials confirmed on  Sunday the treatment is convalescent plasma; they spoke on the condition  of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the issue. The  White House declined to comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Many  scientists and physicians believe that convalescent plasma might  provide some benefit but is far from a breakthrough. It is rich in  antibodies that could be helpful in fighting the [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5),  but the evidence so far has not been conclusive about whether it works,  when to administer it and what dose is needed. On CBS’s “Face the  Nation” on Sunday, former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the blood  product — derived from patients who have survived covid-19 — is  “probably beneficial” for covid-19 patients. The issuance of an  emergency authorization would make it easier to get in some settings.  But he also said it already is widely available, so the change would be  “incremental.”   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**The  announcement comes as Trump has put extraordinary pressure on federal  agencies to test and approve treatments and, especially, a vaccine  against the novel coronavirus which has already killed more than 170,000  Americans. The president’s political advisers believe that having a  vaccine by Election Day is key to his prospects for winning.**"

We’re already pretty shut down from covid. The only fully open areas are essential (hospitals, stores) and small businesses clinging to life due to shutdowns/covid crushing customers and revenue streams. I think if the targets, Walmart’s, Safeway’s, etc shut down there might be a stink (in a good way) but at the same time those workers are hourly and those stores know right now 1) it is a bad time to lose a job and 2) all those workers are easily replaced because no unions and plenty of unemployed people desperate for a job. 

Sadly, I think Americans will be more pissed about the inconvenience than cheering on striking workers for standing up against this bs on behalf of all of us who will be disenfranchised... but my opinion isn’t fated just and opinion.

On the off chance I’m not irritating and offending, and you’re still interested in talking, I’ll continue. 

Re: lunatics only causing fear if we let them, I think that unfortunately isn’t really possible to impact on the individual level. An individual can be fearful or not fearful as a response, but I’m not sure how much an individual’s response would  do much beyond their immediate circle, unless they have a big “following” (from being part of a church group to having social media followers). However there are statistics that indicate mass shooting events precede spikes in gun sales and associated licensing. I’m going to have to look up the stats about the ratio of first time buyers to already-gun-owners (and just buying more). The stat that’s popping up is every Valentine’s Day there’s a spike in sales of so-called “women’s guns” (smaller ones that are associated with being appropriate for smaller sized hands although I only have knowledge of gun statistics, not actually firing a handgun) intended to be given as gifts - but that’s probably not relevant to mass shootings stats haha

Re: masking, I agree that though conservatives *poll* less likely to wear masks than liberals the *actual* incidence of wearing masks when appropriate isn’t so skewed. The reason the polls are so skewed by party might be politics but the 538 poll analysis pointed out that republicans disproportionately live in “red” regions, those regions tend to be more rural, and rural areas might require wearing a mask less often, resulting - there might be more open space, less communal living/no ones living in large apartment complexes, going to a store isn’t a frequent occurrence (going grocery shopping maybe once a week or less vs every few days in a city where people have small apartments with tiny fridges).

My fear re: masking is that it’s most effective in places that cooperate. Much like herd immunity and vaccination, a few too many people refusing to vaccinate can result in things like a measles outbreak (remember Disneyland?). If I recall measles is more contagious than coronavirus, but measles also has a vaccine that most of us get in childhood, so I’m not sure if coronavirus being less transmissible really matters on that front. If the only “vaccine” we have currently is masking, and some don’t mask or don’t mask adequately (talking to you, mister shopper in aisle three, with your chin-mask making you look like a Ballsackian aliens from men in black). I don’t think there’s a large contingent of militant anti-maskers compared to the general population... but when I think of those recent videos showing people walking around downtown Florida cities mask-free, hitting the bar scene, flicking to group gatherings, I fear that whether it’s intentional or not, they pose a threat to this country’s economic recovery, part of which is getting kids back in schools so parents can go to work. 

I agree the lack of masking is mainly one of ignorance - although sometimes seemingly willful ignorance - but sometimes I see inconvenience or pride being the reasons why masks aren’t worn. The data on men being less likely to mask seems pretty true in my life - we see plenty of Karen’s on YouTube but it’s the mild “Kevin’s” who don’t want to wear a mask because “I won’t get sick” seem to think they’re invincible. I feel bad for those who won’t mask because “it makes them look like a pussy” because I think of how fragile and toxic their masculinity must be to drive them to that conclusion. Those who think covid is a “hoax” sometimes fully believe it - and that’s scary on a disinformation level - but often it’s an offhand “ironic” rejoinder used to deflect the point and/or put off some “nosy” person who has, for instance, offered them a free mask or polled them on if they were social distancing; I get that as a concept I think mainly from being on places like reddit where inflammatory quips are often referential but not literal. The hoax disinformation issue I speak of, I honestly don’t know how we’d tell other than looking maybe at social media groups, but again the ironic crowd might skew data. I hope not that many people predominately get their news from Facebook and/or Fox News... 

Even with a fair amount of masking my area isn’t doing so hot. The biggest city near me and pretty much all of the medium ones too have failed to meet state benchmarks for opening the economy/businesses back up. People working from home are limiting the spread while still working, but in suburbia kids are intermingling without masks but so far there hasn’t been crazy upticks in the suburbs, just a steady level that stubbornly refuses to go down. Some suburban businesses are open, but the main sighs of that are people visibly eating outside in make-shift dining areas. Shops are open but empty and often only curbside pick up. Many stores in even wealthy suburban areas arent open even where consumer spending hasn’t dropped much during the pandemic - but they might’ve closed for good, so it’s hard to tell. 

In the more densely populated areas nearme, especially  ones with predominantly lower income multigenerational families, it’s been rising  at faster levels that the richer urban areas lower their rates. They’re doing community-wide surveillance virus and antibody testing in a few lower income multi-generational household  areas under the assumption that at this point everyone’s been exposed. In rural areas where communal living or multigenerational households are super common (all our agricultural areas, which make up a fair amount of the state) the rates are astoundingly high. Shit healthcare means these people and low income people everywhere aren’t doing well, it’s really hard to watch. 

Add in my state’s massive wildfires in the above rural areas making people evacuate to shelters and the smoke pollution we have that exacerbates covid symptoms and we have a recipe for hacking coughing in close proximity to people they haven’t been isolating with. Fabric masks don’t help against smoke, and n95s need to be reserved for medical workers, so people with preexisting breathing problems are a bit fucked. A couple of counties are having to kick tourists out of hotels to send fire victims to because so many hotel rooms are already full of people quarantining for covid before the fire. Oh, and most of these fires are on federal land but the president has not sent in the usual federal firefighting troops that normally fight fires on federal land so state firefighters are having to fight federal land fires when the state’s resources are already stretched thin monetarily by coronavirus and fire-fighting wise by over 360 individual fires burning statewide. Donald “Rake the fires” trump does not feel fondly towards my state. 

Agreed on the cheerleading wars bit and misinformation. I do agree that anyone not taking at least minimal precautions like masking in areas one can’t socially distance or in places like stores is misinformed (if your point was indeed about masking). I’m not sure if you’re saying that people on both sides of the masking issue are misinformed... I mean yes I do hear people still thinking a fabric mask protects the wearer, not the people *around* the wearer, so there is misinformation but I’m not sure the effect of that misinformation is at the same level. still makes me question our general ability to stay accurately informed when I see a couple hanging out not socially distancing and one is wearing a mask to protect themselves but the person they are trying to protect themselves *from* isn’t masking... like, that’s not how fabric masks work. If Billy’s dad has cancer, and billy wants to keep dad safe, so billy wears a mask when he hangs out with his friends but his friends do not mask, them Billy’s dad isn’t really all that protected. 

I don’t consider conservatives “bad people”. I don’t even consider bigots unsalvageable. Bigotry is taught and learned, and it can be unlearned. Information warfare indeed! I think the country would be a lot healthier/better informed/less divided if old news broadcasting laws saying you couldn’t have majority inflammatory ad-selling “news” channels and had to provide the intended informational public service that people wouldn’t hold opposing facts.  

I find both republicans and democrats often are raised by families that associate with that party and grow up in areas that are predominantly of that party - basically we associate with the party of those who raise us. The exception to this rule often are people that seek outside experiences, like attending college or moving away to a region that favors the opposing party, and sometimes those exception people alter their views. Some regions are very mixed but often even then familial party preference is strong. I don’t mean to say families that are evenly split don’t exist - just that they aren’t the most common type statistically. 

Absolutely agree on the ethics front that between the parties ethics and desires are pretty much the same so long as politics doesn’t come up - we all want the same things, to be healthy, happy, have enough money to be comfortable, etc. we want good homes and good schools for our kids and all the usual stuff. Very famous sociological study on this, originally shown in how to help a factory plagued by white-black animosity  stop having issues because the researcher surveyed everyone and showed them that by and large they had the same ideals and desires and weren’t so different. Works the same with animus  religious groups and stuff like that. The final step was to have a big factory picnic where everyone brought their kids, which the researcher thought would humanize the “other”. 

Nice talking with you"
1587,1587,1598047419,"I didn’t love the lack of discretion they used in banning me either. Not sure if this is irony exactly, but they banned me from r/politics until 4 days after the us presidential election...

I was so respectful in requesting their reconsideration and got “no” in return. I know how to be polite, I was being very polite and admitting my stupidity in asking for a second chance. Newp! NO POLITICAL VOICE FOR YOU IN OUR SUPPOSEDLY OPEN FORUM!

Like, I get it, reddits a private company, my free speech isn’t being infringed. But I still feel like maybe I shouldn’t be banned while people literally wishing covid on political figures over the age of 65 (high risk of hospitalization/death) carry on with their not-technically-death-threats... its nonsensical and frankly disappointing to see mods doing a poor/inequitable job on such a vital sub during a critical election.

1590,1590,1597897183,"Patently false.  Obama compromised to Mitt Romney's plan and conceded almost everything to get Republican votes.  They of course had negotiated in bad faith with the single intent to kill it in the crib.  They inserted poison pills, options for legal action, and to tried to make it unworkable.  Obama assumed that after it passed they would agree to fund the web site and implementation which they had negotiated.  The Republicans of course did not and the Democrats, having started negotiating from the middle as usual, resulted in an under funded nearly unworkable transition.  It is actually a small miracle the ACA did not collapse prior to the web site launch.

Same thing as the Great Recession recovery.

More recently, post Obama, the Democrats proved they had learned nothing with the DACA Gov. shut down and the Covid-19 relief."
1591,1591,1597893013,"Couple reasons.

Biden’s got experience in Washington, which we need right now to pick up the pieces of the country and get us back on the road to recovery from COVID and from the trade wars we’ve gotten into.  He and Obama proved that they could help a country in crisis when they helped the country bounce back from the recession and create jobs.  Trump has shown time and time again that he is utterly out of ideas to help us even attempt to get back to being a functioning nation.  It would also help to have a President who isn’t radioactive and abrasive to other world leaders so we can focus on collaborating to get out of this mess and then turn our attention to reducing our national carbon footprint among other looming issues.  Say what you will about Trump’s tact and negotiation style, he certainly hasn’t made us many friends during these last few years.

Now, I know that this will fall upon deaf ears for many who are already convinced that Biden won’t be any use to us as a nation in the Oval Office.  But it’s not just a vote for Biden, you see.  We’re voting for his right to build a cabinet full of experts in their field, not chancers who got gifted the position because they’re friendly with him.  We’re voting for his right to replace the older judges on the Court should they retire to keep our nation moving forward legally.  And we’re voting for a president that will not allow the world to stereotype us as a nation of jingoistic, reactionary fools.

If you support Trump or one of the third parties, or even if you just don’t like Biden, I don’t agree with you, but you have the right to have that opinion.  I can do my best to sway you, but I won’t waste my breath if it doesn’t work the first time.  Time will tell what the right decision is.  And I’m willing to put money on the fact that Biden is the right decision."

If you don’t think that I can’t convince you. I hope that doesn’t come across as hugely rude, because I more mean it as a “we can agree to disagree and not become enemies” way. Different opinions, same goal of not letting this government be steamrolled by people who wish to hinder democracy. 

I agree that staying inside  political fear-mongering bubble is dangerous to ones mental health. Thank you for you offer, it’s very kind. I do pay a fair amount of attention to what’s going on, and it definitely isn’t something that makes me feel optimistic, but I also realize that without being willing to accept that there are bad actors we need to rally against we are sitting ducks. Right now I’m surrounded by a lot of very liberal people who have the idea that “the government will work it out”. They don’t believe reports about nurses being forced to re-use masks (nurse mother: “that’s against code no ones doing that”), de joy removing mail sorting machines (“that isn’t happening”) and still believe those videos of peaceful old men being beaten by dhs agents (“they can’t do that’s, that’s illegal” like that stops it) - and if those things truly happened “the people in charge will fix it”. Many have faith in the same system that delivered trump to the Whitehouse - to these people’s great shock - won’t keep him there this November. It is those people I speak of when I say there is a left contingency that simply doesn’t appear to have a stomach for anything resembling a revolution or even surge of backlash. 

While the people protesting have gotten wiser about protecting themselves from the brutality by authorities used quelling protests, it has also had the impact of making people who do not want to risk being injured think twice about going to protests or speaking up outside social media bubbles. With covid in the mix it’s very easy to feel like there are a million reasons to stay home and safe instead of protest injustice that might not affect you; comfortable suburban white leftists with enough savings and a home to weather this storm aren’t universally stepping up. I’ve seen some evidence of white people with means participating in housing commissions and police brutality task force city hall meetings, which is awesome, seriously, very heartening because I didn’t see that a few years ago. 

I would also love to think the protestors have a chance of actually winning a skirmish against police/dhs agents - I don’t want it to come to that, because I value the lives of my fellow people living in the US - but I don’t have faith that we won’t be trounced. 

I hope what your saying is true. I really fucking do. Believe me, I look forward to the day when I can take like *several* months off from contemplating politics and even a short break from thinking about social justice because fuck am I tired.  I want to go back to not feeling like my parents and a large section of my friend group are part of the problem of apathy. I want to feel unburdened by the fear of four more years of democracy being deconstructed in front of us. Desperately so. I imagine you feel that same, although you do appear to be handling it with significantly more grace."
1594,1594,1597856758,"&gt; Trump is the candidate for peace, Biden the candidate for war.

In general that may be true. But Trump makes an exception for Iran's oil and he continues Obama's illegal occupation of 1/3 of Syria -- and he bluntly says we're there for Syria's oil.

But lolbertarian4america is right: The election won't be determined on issues of war and peace.

The election will be most determined by how our clown president has bungled and botched the COVID-19 virus and has made the US a laughingstock.

We're #1 alright -- #1 in virus deaths by a longshot, and even with Trump working to hinder testing, we're #1 in the number of virus cases. That's a tragic embarrassment and an indictment of our immoral and broken for-profit health care system.

Trump suggested he'd only be accepting of the covid relief bill's inclusion of USPS funding, if they compromised on Republican points for helping the public and businesses. Democrats made it clear they really want the USPS point, because they intend to completely change our nation votes at the last minute, and that change relies heavily on the long broken USPS. Clips of this comment were presented out of context and spun into something they were not.

We are constantly re-organizing the USPS, because it is a sinking ship of a government entity and has been for at least 30 years. 

I remember people complaining when Obama re-organized and removed a bunch of mail drop offs. One of the same things that they are complaining about Trump's USPS re-organization. Then people are complaining that the extra mail-sorting machine being removed from low volume areas in Ohio to areas who need them more...and similar misleading garbage."

1598,1598,1597782581,"Are you aware of how long and bloody the civil war was? What it did to our economy? That the confederacy, while beaten, refused to give up and quickly morphed into the antebellum south, segregation and laws that kept black people essentially slaves (things like black people break the law by *not* having a job, but can’t leave their old job without their bosses *permission*, and can’t get hired for a new job without their old bosses *permission*, so a boss could simply not pay their black employees while refusing to allow them to quit working without being arrested or leave for a new job without their boss okaying it - their boss who doesn’t want them to leave, because they are getting free labor out of refusing to release them from their “job”). Then poll taxes, Jim Crow laws, redlining, and good old intimidation, threat of lynchings, or outright burning down towns if the blacks got to “uppity” (became wealthy or owned businesses or property; see the burning down of “black wall street” and other similar massacres). 

The people who supported the confederacy and slavery were outnumbered by slaves and northern populations. But many northern people and even southern people who weren’t living it rich on a plantation with a veritable “human farm” of slaves (forcing black peoples to have children who would be lifelong slaves too, often via rape) were against the concept of racial equality so they didn’t really want to deal with the whole messy slave issue. 

The above relates nicely to the current issues we have surrounding racial equity, along with other forms of equity like closing the  education gap by funding low-income schools (which currently are funded by property taxes, which means white/wealthy areas have better funded schools) and wealthy gap via a restructuring of our economy, tax laws, and even social programs funded by the government with the purpose of righting previous wrongs that kept people of color from creating lasting/generational wealth. Things like reducing the budget for policing of low-level drug trade that ends up creating situations where police shoot POC and increasing the funding for social services provide mental health counseling or that keep low-level non-violent criminals out of jail and into education and job training programs scare the shit out of people who think police keep them safe - but police aren’t similarly keeping low income and POC safe. 

I also don’t think “backlash” will do much. Trump doesn’t care about backlash. Covid has proven that if the rest of his presidency hasn’t. He cares about getting re-elected and gaining more power. He literally doesn’t care if 70% of the country hates him so long as he remains in power. That’s how autocrats work."

But the article's first paragraph flushes out their thinking:

&gt; When President Donald Trump was challenged by Axios national political correspondent Jonathan Swan to respond to the fact that, ""a thousand Americans are dying a day"" due to COVID-19, the president responded as though the grim tally was perfectly acceptable, saying, ""They are dying, that's true. And it is what it is."" While observers were aghast at the callousness of his statement, it should not have surprised us. Trump had warned that the death toll would be high, and he had asked us months ago to get used to the idea. In late March, the White House Coronavirus Task Force had projected that 100,000 to 240,000 Americans would die from the virus. Rather than unveil an aggressive plan to tackle the spread and prevent the projected mortality figures, the president had said, ""I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead.""

1607,1607,1597527413,"Agreed. Just fucking... agreed. I’m at my wits end. Bernie wasn’t my top choice but he was a close second, and my first was limping along. I gritted my teeth and voted Bernie in a show of democratic solidarity. I’m pretty sure my parents voted Biden “because he’ll be the democratic candidate” (assuming fate was already sealed when Bernie was still in the race) and maybe warren “because I want to vote for her” (pretty much throwing their primary vote away). Yeah, mom, I liked warren too, but guess what I showed up to vote like an adult not a petulant toddler who can’t compromise for a coalition candidate. 

Biden won, so I got behind him, because I was desperate for change and hoped he’d fill his cabinet with people who actually would change things. It wasn’t ideal, but I’d get behind any chance to stop this rapid decline into fascism while we waste the only time we have left before our climate fucks us for fucking it up so royally all these decades. I figured Biden could apply a tourniquet to stop the covid bleeding enough to get to work. I thought maybe he could convince white, comfortable voters to give a damn with his supposed charm for empathy. Biden was the wholly inadequate futon mattress thrown near the hopeful landing zone of the country as it flies off a cliff. It won’t be enough, but it’s the only hope we have. A hope that there’s a slim chance instead of none. A chance that we can cut the damage trump will do in half by preventing his second term. 

Im sure Biden won’t run the administration as I would ideally like, but im also certain I won’t like trumps next four years better than Biden’s. I wish he’d picked someone besides Harris to catch the presidency should he die in office, but again, it’s better than trump. I don’t like pelosi either but if the election is rigged pelosi will likely still win in CA  retain her speaker position; if no election is held and the for some reason the courts don’t decide to hear it like last time but refuse to get involved due to the constitutional line of succession dictating what happens pelosi might be next in line. If the election isn’t held and pelosi isn’t elected at all because the federal results are rejected as invalid due to there not *being* a federal election the the democrats in the house elect a new speaker and that speaker becomes president on jan20 if no president is elected. Its unlikely mcconnell would allow a democratic speaker to become president regardless of who it is, so I suspect mcconnell would rather delay the election via the power of the senate than allow trump to simply not hold a fed election, as mcconnell is up for re-election also and has until his term ends to make sure he keeps his office. If no federal election is held he is out of Congress along with pelosi, unless Kentucky’s federal election votes are accepted by California’s denied.  

Now the election is being stolen in a way that is far more traumatic to democracy than the 2016 large gap between the popular vote and the electoral college or the 2000 contested election where under 600 votes, a single person certifying the vote count, and 4 days of Supreme Court investigation (upholding that certification while knowing the election itself was deeply flawed, poorly run, and the vote count likely flawed as well) - our democracy *cant* weather this new threat. If trump succeed in a fraudulent election or refuses to accept results we are done."

The problem is if we don’t save democracy from this train ride to hell then we don’t have a chance of moving past any of the issues above that are currently making life unsustainable to say the least. 

Those with resources seem to lack all urgency and most near me are doing more about making current life comfortably livable with no thought towards their responsibility to stop us from crashing off a cliff.

See, diseases aren't named after locations because it fosters racism. And is usually incorrectly attributed. Your moniker of 'Wuhan flu' is one racist, and two, factually incorrect. COVID-19 is a coronavirus, not an influenza virus.

Do you think that COVID-19 is an influenza? If so, what evidence do you have?

Naming diseases after locations [promotes racism and is usually factually incorrect](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/28/us/disease-outbreaks-coronavirus-naming-trnd/index.html).

Several of these European countries had far more severe outbreaks than the USA experienced. Even with the way the US counts its deaths, with everyone who tests positive counted as a COVID death even if the virus was not the cause of death, the numbers are much better here than they were in many European countries.

If it's not Chinese Coronavirus or the Wuhan Flu, it's just COVID-19.

You don't actually want to go down this path, do you? Trump was called a bigot for restricting travel. Pelosi, de Blasio, Cuomo and others were encouraging people to go to the theater or to Chinatown or whatever. de Blasio and Cuomo were angry at Trump for suggesting he might order a limited quarantine zone around the host spot of New Rochelle and they were dead set against closing the schools even after Trump was in favor of it. And on it goes. No reasonable, well-informed person can truthfully say that Trump's response to the virus was worse than the response from many prominent Democrats including those who have been treated as ""heroes"" in the press."

Hey, all of our right-wing allies -- the coup regime in Honduras or Bolivia, the ""elected"" gov't in Brazil, etc. -- will let Americans go and visit.

It's just the normal/advanced countries of Europe and elsewhere that are barring Americans.

  And for those keeping track, as the US sets record-after-record of deaths due to the Trump flu, we're over 170,000 dead Americans. Our ""esteemed president"" is now accusing the Biden/Harris team of ""politicizing"" the virus.

1613,1613,1597426512,"&gt; The communist government of China hid the Wuhan Flu from the rest of world, allowed their own people to travel and become infected and then ordered the WHO to support their narrative. 

When? The earliest known cases are from December. At the time, they likely had no idea of what they were facing.

Wuhan was locked down as of [January 23rd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdown_in_Hubei). And they locked down a whole state with road blocks, patrol drones, and wouldn't let people leave their homes.

Currently, the US has the highest infection rate, and we are the ones spreading [COVID-19 around the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdown_in_Hubei). So, you are saying that we should lock down all our cities, have armed patrols, force everyone inside at gun point? That sounds insane.

&gt; Why do support such a government that's responsible for so many deaths?

They aren't responsible. They didn't 'make' this virus. Its a natural, hard to control disease. It spreads with a mind of its own. Its the United State's problem that we can't control the disease.

Every other country on Earth has managed it, but we haven't. The failure is on us, and our current administration.

1617,1617,1597351550,"TLDR: GatewayPundit are liars.

Now, lets look at the list of lies from Gateway pundit.

&gt; 1.)  Dr. Fauci says he warned Trump in January that the US was in real trouble but that is not what he said publicly.

What is the actual quote:

&gt; Obviously, you need to take it seriously and do the kind of things that the CDC and the Department of Homeland Security are doing. But this is not a major threat for the people of the United States. And this is not something that the citizens of the United States **right now** should be worried about.

Things change. That is how life works.

&gt; 2.)  Dr. Fauci warned of an apocalyptic coronavirus pandemic — then just weeks later he compared the coronavirus to a bad flu.

The fatality rate of COVID-19 is similar to a bad flu. We just have no vaccine for COVID-19, and it spreads far more easily.

&gt; 3.) Dr. Fauci based all of his predictions on the garbage IHME models that were OFF BY MILLIONS and then later told reporters, “You can’t really rely on models.”

The IHME model is a super simple worst case model. Take the fatality rate and multiply by the susceptible population. This is a worst case number, and we never want to be there. We did respond. Just not very well.

&gt; 4.) On March 20th Dr. Fauci jumped in and “corrected” the president during a press briefing on hydroxychloroquine treatment for coronavirus saying, “You got to be careful when you say ‘fairly effective.’ It was never done in a clinical trial… It was given to individuals and felt that maybe it worked.”

[HCQ doesn't work.](https://www.wired.com/story/hydroxychloroquine-still-doesnt-do-anything-new-data-shows/) Stop trying to beat this dead horse.

&gt; 5.)  Dr. Fauci pushed these garbage models every step of the way.

The models aren't garbage. GatewayPundit's nonsense interpretation of them is.

&gt; 6) On Easter Dr. Fauci suggested President Trump should have shut down the economy in February…  When the number of known cases in the US was around 100.  Fauci later walked back his attacks.

Yeah. We probably should have.

&gt; 7.) Dr. Fauci said cruises were OK on March 9th.  That was a huge error.

That was dumb. Cruises have always been a death trap of disease.

&gt; 8.) Dr. Fauci said malls, movies and gyms were OK on February 29th.  That was another huge mistake.

They were... on February 29th. Things change.

&gt; 9.) Dr. Fauci was wrong about the first coronavirus deaths in the country. Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx and the CDC were off by nearly a month. California officials revealed in April that a patient in Santa Clara died from coronavirus on February 6th not February 29th.

Dr. Fauci isn't a time traveller. He can't know that Santa Clara will find an old case that was COVID-19 before it happens.

&gt; 10.) Dr. Fauci and the CDC missed the millions and millions of US citizens who had already contracted the coronavirus before the draconian lockdowns took place.  Knowing this could have prevented the economic calamity.

Lock downs are put in place when you know there is large scale community spread, and you need to hit the emergency button. The CDC knew there was large scale community spread. Hence the lockdowns.

This statement barely makes any sense.

&gt; 11.) On April 15, 2020, Fauci endorses Tinder hookups, unbelievably. Then said Americans should never shake hands again.

What did Fauci actually say:

&gt; “You know, that’s tough,” replied the befuddled National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director to the curveball. “Because that’s what’s called relative risk.”

&gt; Then he dropped the bombshell. “If you’re willing to take a risk — and you know, everybody has their own tolerance for risks — you could figure out if you want to meet somebody,” said Fauci, who was named a candidate for People magazine’s “Sexiest Man Alive” award.

&gt; He added, “If you want to go a little bit more intimate, well, then that’s your choice regarding a risk.”

So... not exactly a ringing endorsement. More a lesson about personal risk assessment.

I'd happily go on... but this is a wall of text already."
1618,1618,1597336904,"Even insists on calling 'COVID-19' the 'Wuhan flu' and I'm sure, sees zero hypocrisy in calling others racist."
1619,1619,1597332786,"&gt; You conveniently mixed up a lot of timelines there (and you well know it) but that kind of pseudology you've perpetrated throughout this thread so I'm neither surprised nor concerned.

Where? Where are my timelines mixed up? All of those citations have dates, and those dates aren't mine, they are cited.

&gt; What does interest me is why you and other liberal extremist would go to such lengths to excuse, mollify and kow-tow to the murderous communist government of China who didn't care how many people died across the globe from the Wuhan Flu as long as they kept themselves in power.

Do you mean Trump? Lets look at what Trump has said about China.

&gt; “One of the many great things about our just signed giant Trade Deal with China is that it will bring both the USA &amp; China closer together in so many other ways. Terrific working with President Xi, a man who truly loves his country. Much more to come!” Jan 22

Huh. Odd.

&gt; “China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!” Jan 24

Okay. So China is helpful

&gt; ""China is not in great shape right now, unfortunately. But they're working very hard. We'll see what happens. But we're working very closely with China and other countries."" Jan 30

&gt; ""I just spoke to President Xi last night, and, you know, we're working on the — the problem, the virus. It's a — it's a very tough situation. But I think he's going to handle it. I think he's handled it really well. We're helping wherever we can."" Feb 7

&gt; “Just had a long and very good conversation by phone with President Xi of China. He is strong, sharp and powerfully focused on leading the counterattack on the Coronavirus. He feels they are doing very well, even building hospitals in a matter of only days … Great discipline is taking place in China, as President Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation. We are working closely with China to help! Feb 7

&gt; ""I think China is very, you know, professionally run in the sense that they have everything under control,"" Trump said. ""I really believe they are going to have it under control fairly soon. You know in April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather. And that's a beautiful date to look forward to. But China I can tell you is working very hard."" Feb 10

That is all Trump dude.

I think China acted with an authoritarian hand. They likely under reported their infection numbers. But they did give virus samples and the genome to other nations. They also published really helpful information about their first known cases.

Could China have done more? I don't actually know what more you want China to have done.

What more do you wish China had done?

Also, ""Wuhan Flu"" is a highly inaccurate term. COVID-19 is not a flu or even related to the flu. That is racist."
1620,1620,1597330500,"&gt; They could have put quarantines in place, as our popular &amp; successful president did saving millions of innocent American lives. 

They did. They locked down all of [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdown_in_Hubei). With a strictness and autothoritarianism that the US could, would and probably should never muster.

&gt; They could have shared what they knew about the Wuhan Flu with the world but they did not

They did. China published the virus's genome as early as [Jan 11th](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/chinese-researchers-reveal-draft-genome-virus-implicated-wuhan-pneumonia-outbreak).

Even Trump said this.

&gt; “China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!” Trump Jan 22

So what's up with that?

&gt; They could have allowed the WHO to get a head's up on the Chinese Flu

They also did that. The WHO had access to enough information that Germany was able to develop a [COVID-19 test also in January](https://www.dzif.de/en/researchers-develop-first-diagnostic-test-novel-coronavirus-china).

That seems reasonably helpful to me.

&gt; For his bold and decisive action in saving millions of American lives, as well as his other many policy successes, our president will easily win re-election this Fall.

Donald Trump has killed more American's than all of Vietnam... six times over. He has failed miserably. Can you name another country on Earth with a death toll approaching 200,000 dead?

No. You can't. Because Trump's response is so terrible, that 200k are dead."
1621,1621,1597269302,"&gt; You refuse to condemn or even acknowledge the far left communist government in China role in causing the Wuhan Flu to be spread across the globe.

See, the thing is it didn't. The virus is a virulent monster. We knew this kind of thing could happen. [Obama put a lot of effort into pandemic preparation](https://khn.org/news/evidence-shows-obama-team-left-a-pandemic-game-plan-for-trump-administration/). And Trump destroyed or ignored all of it.

We have known since 2003, that coronaviruses can be dangerous. The world got off easy with SARS and MERS. And COVID-19 came along and delivered a real gut punch.

But most countries have recovered. The US is alone in how poorly we have handled this. And we are suffering for it.

None of this is China's fault. This disease has signs that it was spreading around the world long before China knew it existed. [The disease was in France in December](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/doctors-date-first-covid-19-case-in-france-to-late-december-67510).

The US in particular could have dealt with this. There were [two specific](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/genetic-analysis-raises-more-questions-about-the-history-of-washington-states-coronavirus-outbreak/) [entry events](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-new-york-city-cases-came-from-europe-not-whuan-china-asia-research-shows-genome-test/) into the US that delivered the vast majority of the cases: Washington and NYC.

If we had proper contact tracing and quarantine up and running by the time that Trump barred travel with China, we could have spotted the bug at the boarder. We could all be enjoy NFL and baseball games, and even school.

Well, that never happened. The disease spread and ravage an unprepared nation.

None of that is China's fault.

That is Trump's fault. An absolute failure to respond effectively. If you want to name this thing, its Trump virus."
1622,1622,1597204069,"&gt; The term Wuhan or Chinese Flu is not just accurate it's definitive.

""Chinese flu"" is super racist. And also wildly incorrect. SARS-2 is not an [influenza virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_virus). Totally different creatures. 

Secondly. Was the 'Spanish' flu started in Spain? [No.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu) It started in the US... in Kansas. So trying to say there is a 'convention' of naming diseases after places of origin is not universal or usually correct.

[So, we as a world found non-racist universal methods of naming new viruses and diseases.](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-\(covid-2019\)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it)

Naming a virus or a disease after a location is nonsense. All naming of species should simply be [taxonomical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_classification). There are reasons for this. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-2.

Why is it named [COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cdcresponse/about-COVID-19.html)?

Its named for 'CO' as in corona 'VI' as in virus, and 'D' as in disease. Good job! We are learning together. Now, why the 19? Because it was discovered in 2019! Isn't that cool.

Now, why SARS-2, because the closest named relative to this coronavirus was the [SARS virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome).

Viruses and the diseases they cause each have their own names. Isn't that interesting?

See, not racist at all. Informative, scientific, but not racist. 'Wuhan flu'... well, that's racist and wildly incorrect. Double not goods."

You are welcome to speak as you like. But terms like 'Wuhan flu', 'China virus', and all disease names that specify a place instead of a virus... are inherently racist. You are also welcome to be racist.

Now the thing with being a racist and using racist language... is that other people are free to judge you for it. They are free to ostracize and criticize you for it. That is their and my first amendment right.

Right. So using the term 'Chinese virus' will increase the likelihood that people make the incorrect association of Chinese people with COVID-19. Do you see how that could happen?

&gt; There's a myriad of causes for crime. Lack of respect for authority, poor parenting and then some people are just born that way.

So rather than blame the obvious motive, and the stated motive of the attacker, you want to spread blame to 'born that way'? [People aren't born racist.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/06/health/kids-raised-with-bias-wellness/index.html) They learn racism from racist terms like 'Chinese virus' that attempt to blame a class of people for a disease.

You try to blame 'bad parenting'. Well, parents are a common source of racism. If the parents use racist terms like 'Chinese virus' and other unspeakable slurs, then yes. The parents could be partially to blame.

All this makes its way back to using hateful language and terminology.

&gt;  They were the biggest culprit in spreading the virus.

Actually... the US is currently the biggest culprit of spreading the virus. We have 25% of the world's cases, and 4% of the world's population. Most other countries have closed their boarders with us.

At this point, you might want to call COVID-19 the Trump virus."
1627,1627,1597167367,"&gt; And yet you still can't prove there's a causation link between people publicly using the term as the sole motivation for any attack. None.

Right. You are somehow claiming that people yelling 'Chinese virus' and then attacking Chinese people is unrelated to using the racist term 'Chinese virus' instead of the proper name COVID-19.

The attacker is clearly motivated by racism, and using a racist slur during the attack, but according to you, that is not causal. So I'm asking, in your rather shaky hypothesis, what is cause?

Why would someone yell 'Chinese virus!' and then attack a Chinese person other than racism and bigotry inflamed by terms like 'Chinese virus'?"
1628,1628,1597117488,"&gt; Correctly labeling the COVID as Chinese Flu or Wuhan Flu has not caused an increase in attack on Asian Americans and there's ZERO evidence that it has.

It has. You just happen to ignore all evidence.

I provided you dozens of specific stories. Showed general causation through references. You just choose to ignore all evidence.

In addition, even given an example, you claim when the attacker is yelling 'Chinese virus' during the attack that this means 'Causation? Absolutely not.'

Your position is kinda bonkers. The cited attackers plainly state their motive, and you deny their motive was the cause?"
1629,1629,1597114579,"Relation? Everything is relative on some micro scale. Causation? Absolutely not.

So... when someone yells 'that Chinese are spreading disease!' before attacking a Chinese person... those words have no relation to the attack about to ensue?

Like... when you associate a disease, COVID-19, with an ethnicity or location, China, and people yell that before attacking other people... then there is no cause and effect there?

That is your argument?"
1631,1631,1597110394,"His entire point is that Nov. 3rd won't matter! Don't you get what's happening?

Consider a few facts:

* Trump has stated publicly that if every American voted that Republicans would not be elected. He wasn't ""joking"" when he said that.

* Trump has publicly said that *some* states with Republican governors have just fine mail-in voting systems. He never mentioned and states with Democrat governors, he specifically said Republican governors mentioning Florida by name.

* Trump has now appointed a partisan hack to be in charge of the USPS. We're already seeing mail delays and backups with *normal* mail. Due to changes Trump's appointed partisan postal chief made the post office is now running *days behind.* What's it going to be like by election day?  

  Trump's USPS has also said that mail-in votes have to go as First-Class mail thereby increasing the costs by almost X3 (from $0.20/ballot to $0.55) at a time when states are strapped for cash due to COVID-19.

There is a high potential here for a **bloody disaster** on election day.

Trump has already said the votes should all be in on the day after election and counted. That's ignoring the *fact* that in normal elections we don't have the official tally for a week or more after election day.

Trump is *already* questioning the election and refuses to state whether he'll go by the election results.

If we have scattered media reports of mail-in votes being lost or found do you really think Trump is going to concede the election? Or is it more likely that Trump will claim victory and want a ""2nd Amendment Freedom Rally"" of armed supporters to celebrate his election win?

Do you not see the high potential for an administration openly hostile to mail-in voting and now executing a ""Friday night massacre"" of firing and rearranging *dozens of high level USPS positions* and a botched or highly controversial election count?

Do you not see the possibility for a fascist coup in such scenarios?

There is. I cited numerous examples. You just choose to ignore them.

Let me spell some out for you in very specific terms.

&gt; July 31 – Bronx, NY: A man was arrested after harassing an Asian woman on the subway. The man reportedly spat on the woman and yelled at her, ""Asians caused the virus!"" and ""Go back to China! Go back to Manhattan!""

&gt; July 18: An Asian American restaurant owner says he was attacked by a man who refused to comply with the restaurant's health measures. The man allegedly told the restaurant owner, ""Fuck you and your chinky ass policy"" and told him to ""Go back to China, you COVID ass.”

&gt; Wyckoff, NJ: A Chinese restaurant was vandalized with graffiti that read, ""coronavirus"" and ""COVID-19.""

&gt; Newark, DE: Fliers targeting Asian and Asian American students were found at off-campus housing at the University of Delaware, Newark. The flyers included the message ""Kill China Virus.""

&gt; Queens, NY: A man at a Bayside 7-Eleven made anti-Asian remarks regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and then verbally harassed an Asian customer whom he also allegedly pushed.

And on and on."
1634,1634,1597095776,"One, [the Spanish flu did not originate in Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu). [It likely originated in the US.](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/1918-flu-pandemic)

How is the statement that people of Chinese descent were hurt by the racism of the media coverage wrong? Because the paper does a good job of covering the economic impact and characterizing the coverage. For instance:

&gt; SARS affected businesses across Toronto but hit Chinese-owned businesses and those located in China towns even harder. According to various media and business accounts, loss of income was estimated at 40% to 80%. Many respondents reported that public funding for festivals and advertising did not reach the industries and individuals who were impacted the most.

That seems like a huge impact.

And you can accept that Africans were negatively impacted by racism associated with a disease, but you won't accept that Chinese could be impacted? Can you explain that difference?

&gt; None of those paragraphs contain facts.

They do. Each one references a study or press release to support the information. So far, you have offered nothing to counter these points.

&gt; None of those sources prove that words alone has caused undue harm to Asian-Americans.

Nothing in this world can be 'proved' if you simply ignore the evidence. I can not 'prove' the sun will rise tomorrow. It will.

The important aspect is to compile reliable evidence. I've provided plenty of reliable evidence. You simply dismiss it without actually investigating the evidence, or even providing your own counter evidence.

&gt; None of those sources prove that words alone has caused undue harm to Asian-Americans. They're all just conjecture, assumption and opinion based upon a need to force a liberal narrative from what are far-left sites. 

So for you, the use of a racist slur needs to be shown to directly cause the harm before you will acknowledge that using the term is unacceptable?

Do you use other racist slurs in your daily lexicon? Because that same extreme position you laid out also applies to a whole litany of racist language.

If you want direct evidence of the impact of racial slurs, you need to investigate experimental psychology. [Here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/002210318590006X) is one such study.

But we don't need to look at these studies, the perpetrators of such hatred use [the same racist language you do](https://www.adl.org/blog/reports-of-anti-asian-assaults-harassment-and-hate-crimes-rise-as-coronavirus-spreads).

&gt; These incidents include being told to “Go back to China,” being blamed for “bringing the virus” to the United States, being referred to with racial slurs, spat on, or physically assaulted. Statements by public officials referring to COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus,” “Kung Flu” or “Wu Flu” may be exacerbating the scapegoating and targeting of the AAPI community.

Here we have the exact same racist language you just used during actual racist incidents."
1635,1635,1597091185,"Then lets look at the facts.

&gt; Despite its name, most researchers agree that the H1N1 virus that swept the world in 1918 and 1919 didn't originate in Spain, although there's no universal consensus on its exact origins. Instead, the virus came to be associated with Spain for reasons that were largely political.

Do you agree with that statement?

&gt; During the 2003 SARS outbreak, [media coverage of the disease led to the stigmatization](https://www.academia.edu/919335/Yellow_peril_revisited_Impact_of_SARS_on_the_Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Canadian_communities) of Asian communities in countries such as Canada. It devastated Chinese-owned businesses, especially those located in Chinatowns.

Do you take issue with this statement?

&gt; After the 2014 outbreak of Ebola, which is named for a river in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where it was first discovered, [African immigrants in the US reported being turned away from jobs and stores](https://theintercept.com/2014/10/21/cant-ebola-become-latest-racist-national-security-issue/). Others faced questions about how long they had been in the US because of their national origin.

Do you agree with this statement?

&gt; The World Health Organization [issued guidelines in 2015](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/163636/WHO_HSE_FOS_15.1_eng.pdf?sequence=1) calling on scientists, authorities and the media to use best practices when naming new infectious diseases, which include avoiding names of places, people or animals.

Do you agree that the WHO set guidelines for how to properly name a disease?

Now. Lets look at the harms caused by giving a disease a racist moniker.

Two sources were already cited above. [Here](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/12/covid-19-fueling-anti-asian-racism-and-xenophobia-worldwide) are another set of sources. Or [this](https://time.com/5858649/racism-coronavirus/). Or [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/chinese-coronavirus-racist-attacks.html). Or this whole [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_incidents_of_xenophobia_and_racism_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic).
So just to reiterate the point, you said

&gt; There's no evidence that using such nomenclature has caused a single Asian-American to be harmed. None.

I've now provided plenty of evidence. You have not refuted any of it. You simply dismissed it without reason. So, now you have plenty of cases of racism to consider next time you want to make such an ignorant statement."

That is all they are asking for, for people to not have to choose between risking their lives and voting.

If hydroxychloroquine really was effective, then we'd expect to see more obvious disparity in outcomes between countries that frequently use it vs countries that avoid it, and despite lots of eyes looking for one there's (sadly) no such disparity evident.

&gt;When it was pointed out that he actually can’t win in 2020—that he  won’t be on enough ballots to yield 270 electoral votes, and that a  write-in campaign isn’t feasible—and thus was serving as a spoiler, West  replied: “I’m not going to argue with you. Jesus is King.”  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;West rebuffed various attempts to clarify who was driving his ballot  access or strategy and whether it’s being coordinated by or with  Republican-affiliated officials. He does, however, appear to have a  continuing relationship with the Trump White House. West says that he’s  “designing a school within the next month” and that “I’m meeting with  Betsy DeVos about the post-Covid curriculum.” (The Secretary of  Education’s press office hadn’t responded to a request for comment by  the time we published.)  
&gt;  
&gt;“I like Kanye very much,” [President Trump told reporters](https://news.yahoo.com/trump-kanye-wests-presidential-run-224359051.html) at the White House yesterday. “No, I have nothing to do with him getting on the ballot. We'll have to see what happens.”  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;West did not respond when asked whether he feels he’s being used. When I  pointed out to West that the slapdash operation to get him on the  ballot, which includes one operative previously arrested for voter fraud  and [multiple West “electors” from the same address](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/08/05/rapper-kanye-west-files-ohio-run-president/3298475001/), didn’t feel like a Kanye West production, West replied that it was a “God production.”  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;However, he was reticent to criticize Trump besides that. “Trump is  the closest president we’ve had in years to allowing God to still be  part of the conversation,” he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;And West was eager to criticize Biden, and expressed comfort with the  idea of doing damage to the former vice president’s White House  chances. **“I’m not denying it; I just told you.”**

There was no national direction at the federal level, only Trump haphazardly playing for the cameras like the reality TV star clown he is.

Clueless red state governors trying to follow Trump's ""lead"" and refusing to acknowledge the virus, refusing to shut down and then reopening things up too soon -- those were major stupid moves no doubt, but even CA who shut down early is being hammered by the virus.

&gt; Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza

'No significant effect' does not mean it does not work. It means that the studies did not produce statistics reliable enough to make a firm conclusion.

The reports are all using randomized controlled trials. This is normally great, but these types of trials require large sample sizes to measure anything statistically meaningful.

Look specifically at [Figure 2](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994-f2). This figure is at the heart of it. Notice how the thin little line always touches the middle? This is the margin of error.

The article cited by AEI is not using the newest studies or information. It is all old data from a few months ago.

&gt; A Nordic study found that keeping primary schools open during the pandemic had little or no effect on contagion rates, and that there was no increased risk for teachers.

The cited article can be found [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-19/covid-s-spread-in-schools-is-questioned-in-latest-nordic-study). European countries are able to open their schools because they have [2% of new cases of COVID-19 that the US has](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html). European countries are in far better shape than the US.

&gt; But according to my American Enterprise Institute colleagues John Bailey and Jessica Schurz, about 17 percent of all public school teachers and 22 percent of public school principals are in the vulnerable age range of 55 and older.

Their vulnerability frankly doesn't matter. They are still able to catch and spread the illness. We need to limit the spread. And to say, 'oh, only a few teachers will die' will not be acceptable to those teachers.

Those teachers will quit or strike once COVID hits their region. Then schools will close without any backup plan."

So, let's break it down.

1) during the pandemic secret police were seizing shipments of PPE headed for blue states and redirecting them. This became so bad the the New England Patriots had to fly to China and, in an event unheard of in modern history, the NYS Police escorted the NE Patriots team bus down the NY Thruway to deliver emergency supplies to hospitals.

2) during the Pandemic covid patients weren't allowed on the hospital ships in NY harbor.

3) Trump told the states to purchase supplies on the open market. Trump used the purchasing power of the federal government to simultaneously stockpile supplies and drive up prices. Then we find out that people in his orbit are invested in pharma! Gasp!

4) he said things that implied he expected people to be his sycophants in exchange for help. This isn't about his ego. It's about public service. 

Here's the thing, I don't agree with Bush II but he treated us as a nation. It's as if he had good intentions but bad ideas. Ok. Honest opposition. Perhaps other crimes were committed. Not like this.

I don't get that honest intent from Trump. He's not the Businessman using his skills and knowledge for the good of all. He's a Businessman making a buck and a sad child still acting out for Daddy's approval.

For example, there really are still people who will buy the argument that since few kids die from covid-19, that means it's safe to open schools - completely ignoring the fact that more kids have long term health damage than die, and the even bigger factor that kids would spread the disease without knowing it and bring it back to teachers and to the kids' families, causing a surge of cases in adults that would require closing everything down again.  For another example, there really are people who don't know that Sweden's response to the pandemic turned out really badly - not quite as badly as the US, but not an example to emulate.  For another example, there really are people who might nod their head at the example of a state closing down more in March when there were few identified cases, and opening up later when there were more cases - not noticing that the article doesn't even bring up testing rates, masks, or R.

You may support the corrupt incompetent clown in the White House, but that makes **you** a minority -- the majority of Americans have *never* supported Trump. Again, he rules by the power of gov't and not by a ""mandate"" of the American people."

Well, I know some other 'experts' that share [his opinion](https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/stella-immanuel-trump-covid-19-demon-sperm-hydroxychloroquine-20200730.html), but they also have no expertise... except in the area of demon sperm. ED:SP"
1706,1706,1596221732,"I think you need to actually look at those 'lies' and realize those are actually true.

Lets look at your source.

&gt; On March 31, Dr. Fauci presented a graph based on the Ferguson model, developed at Imperial College London, to show that if we did not adopt ""mitigation measures"" the number of deaths in the United States would total more than 2 million.

That is true. If the US did nothing and COVID-19 with a fatality rate of about 1% was allowed to infect the majority of the US population, the total deaths would be 2-3 million.

We did not do 'nothing'. We acted to slow the spread. Not as well as every other country on Earth, but we did something.

&gt; Dr. Fauci coupled that prediction with another graph claiming that if mitigation measures were adopted, the numbers of deaths would likely be in the range of 200,000.

We already have [150,000 deaths](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/). Soon, we will reach 200,000. Also not a lie.

The article then complains a lot about the 'Ferguson model'. But that model is a model for taking no action and just letting a disease run through a population. Those are worst case scenario numbers.

This is 'anti-model' argument is completely disingenuous. In each case, countries and people took action to prevent the fatality rate from reaching those huge numbers. That is the point of a worst case model. We need those models to understand if we need to act, and how much.

We never want to be any where near the fatality rate of a worse case model.

Now, lets look at the lies in the article that you are referencing.

&gt; Unlike the United States and other nations that followed extreme mitigation measures, Sweden’s GDP actually grew in the first quarter.

Um, for one quarter, now Sweden's [economy is in the tank](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiOreSLkvjqAhUuGDQIHYWmAHQQFjACegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Fstory%2Fsweden-didnt-impose-a-lockdown-its-economy-is-just-as-bad-as-its-neighbors-who-did-2020-06-25&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-IymugKwnyg9rSoGJ5Ds9). Sweden also has more cases of [COVID than its neighbors](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiOreSLkvjqAhUuGDQIHYWmAHQQFjAAegQIAhAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F07%2F07%2Fbusiness%2Fsweden-economy-coronavirus.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw3KBtaMogfHlMgqMuIIrfRj).

So this portion is also a lie. Sweden has not done 'well' during this disaster.

&gt; As a result of Dr. Fauci’s advice ... many died by suicide secondary to depression ...

We simply [don't know](https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article/doi/10.1093/qjmed/hcaa202/5857612) what the impact of COVID on the suicide rate [yet](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/health/pandemic-coronavirus-suicide-health.html). Suicide rates tend to increase after all natural disaster and economic downturns.

When I would bring up something Trump had done that I had considered corrupt she wouldn't even engage, she didn't know it had happened, doesn't know much, and kept calling my points ""Cnn parrot points"" even though I don't watch CNN.

It was fucking weird, and gross.  We ended our friendship.  

I mentioned to her the famous ""grab her by the pussy"" comment by Trump and she was like ""oh that's just how people talk!""

1712,1712,1596207170,"&gt;Is this so people do not realize that the common flu kills more people than COVID or to hide the 99.6% COVID recovery rate?

Between 2018 and 2019 the common flu had ~ 490,600 hospitalizations and ~ 34,200 deaths, in 7 months Covid 19 is currently at  4,580,000 confirmed infections and 146,052 deaths excluding those with the flu. 

So basic math says 146,052 is &gt; than 34,200 which would make the statement ""the common flu kills more people than COVID"" incorrect. Basic math also says if 146,052 people out of 4,580,000 died the recovery rate would be lower than 99.6%, so that statistic is wrong too.

On to the original question ""why did the CDC and WHO not publish Flu statistics for this year"" 1) 2020 is not over, so they can't release the data for the entire year, 2) the existence of a global pandemic consisting of a similar but sperate viral infection causing hospitalizations and deaths has made it more difficult to identify influenza vs Covid deaths, 3) both organizations are absolutely putting out 2020 influenza data, infact they are showing it on a week by week basis for easier study.

* Doesn't detail HOW  ""the Trump administration’s shortsighted policies have left us unprepared for a dangerous epidemic"".

&gt; So you're saying no immunity no chance at vaccine.

I explained this so many times to you it hurts my brain that you can still get this wrong.  I even explained it like I would to a five year old.  A five year old would understand this by now, it's amazing to me that you still don't.  I'm done trying on that front, you cant even admit that you confused ""strand"" which refers to the general structure of RNA/DNA, with ""strain"" which refers to genetic variations.  You are simply incapable of learning.

There are several studies proving the opposite, but I guess you're just carrying on with your theme of being a potato.

&gt; Good thing the survival rate don't change. Cause it's currently less then a bad flu season for all under 70.

Absolutely moronic.  Practically every single study that's been released on the survival rate says otherwise, not to mention what I just finished explaining to you on how survival rate measured over a month doesn't answer the question of what the survival rate over years is.

&gt; I'm not scared of a virus to the point I feel the need to shelter at home while supplies dwindle and the world still spins

Making you wear a mask in Walmart might lead to the powers that be demanding you wear pants in Walmart as well!  What tyranny.

But if that's what you really believe, then what do you say about the countries that have successfully curbed the virus?  Italy was hit even harder than us in the beginning.  Right now we're getting about 70,000 new cases a day, they're getting 100 new cases.  Did Italy lose its freedom to achieve this?  Is their democracy doomed now?

How can I explain this like you're 5...

Imagine a Mr. Potatohead doll.  Against pathogens that we develop longer-lasting immunities, we would have our immune system detect the potato, since that is the essential, unchanging part that makes the virus work.  But against things like coronaviruses, our antibodies are fooled because they are reacting against non-essential features of the potatohead doll-- his hat, his eyes, his nose, his mouth, all stuff that is basically just mix and match for the virus.

When you get re-infected by Covid-19, it isn't because something fundamental changed about the virus.  It's the same virus, with the same spike protein, targeting the same receptors to gain access to the same cells.  It literally just put on a slightly different pair of potato-head eyes.  All other things held constant, your survival rate is unchanged, it is the same potatohead doll as before.

Let me repeat, just to make sure I got through your potatohead-- it's functionally the the same virus.  It has the same effect.

I'm not going to waste my time explaining the complexities of viral genetics, or how your immune system is waaaaaaaaay more complicated than just T-cells when I'm pretty sure you dont even know the difference between a strain and a strand."

1750,1750,1595290255,"Maybe you've misunderstood.  The studies I am talking about are focused on how long your IMMUNITY to Covid-19 lasts, not the survival rate.  If you wanted to know about the survival rate, you'd look at a study that studied the survival rate.  You don't check your car's oil by looking at the gas tank, dipstick.

I'm still amazed you thought immunity would be forever.  Ever heard of the common cold?  Or the flu?  Both coronaviruses, same as COVID-19.  The structure of a coronavirus makes it trivially easy for the virus to mask or alter its spike proteins and thus avoid detection by antibodies-- we pretty much take it as a given that you're not going to develop permanent immunity to them.

In fact, since you seem so ignorant to how immunology works, lemme just lay one of the worst case scenarios on you.

Let's say three conditions are met:

1)  We find that your natural antibodies to Covid-19, on average, only remain effective for about 4 months (a reasonable guess given current evidence).

2)  We find that the virus commonly develops live colonies inside your body that persist after infection.  Think Mary Mallon's gallbladder and typhoid (typhoid, incidentally, is yet another class of pathogen that you never develop permanent immunity to, in case you were wondering why you couldn't just get eat raw chicken as a kid and never have to worry about salmonella ever again).  This would be unusual, but not impossible.

3)  We find that even in asymptomatic people infected with COVID-19, it still inflicts permanent damage.  You might not notice a little lung scarring when you're young and healthy, but you'll notice it when you're older.  This one is actually fairly likely, at least for a percentage of infected persons.

Combine the three and what do you get?  You get a person infected with Covid-19 today who's just fine the first time around, probably doesn't even notice it, but is doomed to get it again in 4 months no matter what precautions they take, and again 4 months after that, and keeps getting it until the cumulative damage to their lungs and other organs kills them.

You wanna talk about survival rate?  This is a new disease my friend!  There's a dozen critical things about it that we don't even know.  We're so busy trying to find refrigerated trucks to store the dead bodies that we really have no idea what the long-term impacts will be.  For all we know, it's possible all the 20 and 30 somethings that got it last month and never even noticed will be dropping dead in a couple years.

So please.  We don't know jack, and you know even less.  Stop pretending otherwise."

But the biggest clue that they were hiding the numbers were right there in plain sight: compared to states with similar positive numbers they had suspiciously half the deaths."
1753,1753,1595214885,"The original text of the article is as follows:

---

Some of us knew from the beginning that Donald Trump wasn’t up to the job of being president, that he wouldn’t be able to deal with a crisis that wasn’t of his own making. Still, the magnitude of America’s coronavirus failure has shocked even the cynics.

At this point Florida alone has an average daily death toll roughly equal to that of the whole European Union, which has 20 times its population.

How did this happen? One key element in our deadly debacle has been extreme shortsightedness: At every stage of the crisis Trump and his allies refused to acknowledge or get ahead of disasters everyone paying attention clearly saw coming.

Blithe denials that Covid-19 posed a threat gave way to blithe denials that rapid reopening would lead to a new surge in infections; now that the surge is upon us, Republican governors are responding sluggishly and grudgingly, while the White House is doing nothing at all.

And now another disaster — this time economic rather than epidemiological — is just days away.

To understand the cliff we’re about to plunge over, you need to know that while America’s overall handling of Covid-19 was catastrophically bad, one piece — the economic response — was actually better than many of us expected. The CARES Act, largely devised by Democrats but enacted by a bipartisan majority late in March, had flaws in both design and implementation, yet it did a lot both to alleviate hardship and to limit the economic fallout from the pandemic.

In particular, the act provided vastly increased aid to workers idled by lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus. U.S. unemployment insurance is normally a weak protection against adversity: Many workers aren’t covered, and even those who are usually receive only a small fraction of their previous wages. But the CARES Act both expanded coverage, for example to gig workers, and sharply increased benefits, adding $600 to every recipient’s weekly check.

These enhanced benefits did double duty. They meant that there was far less misery than one might otherwise have expected from a crisis that temporarily eliminated 22 million jobs; by some measures poverty actually declined.

They also helped sustain those parts of the economy that weren’t locked down. Without those emergency benefits, laid-off workers would have been forced to slash spending across the board. This would have generated a whole second round of job loss and economic contraction, as well as creating a huge wave of missed rental payments and evictions.

So enhanced unemployment benefits have been a crucial lifeline to tens of millions of Americans. Unfortunately, all of those beneficiaries are now just a few days from being thrown overboard.

For that $600 weekly supplement — which accounts for most of the expansion of benefits — applies only to benefit weeks that end “on or before July 31.” July 31 is a Friday. State unemployment benefit weeks typically end on Saturday or Sunday. So the supplement will end, in most places, on July 25 or 26, and millions of workers will see their incomes plunge 60 percent or more just a few days from now.

Two months have gone by since the House passed a relief measure that would, among other things, extend enhanced benefits through the rest of the year. But neither Senate Republicans nor the White House has shown any sense of urgency about the looming crisis. Why?

Part of the answer is that Trump and his officials are, as always, far behind the coronavirus curve. They’re still talking about a rapid, V-shape recovery that will bring us quickly back to full employment, making special aid to the unemployed unnecessary; they’re apparently oblivious to what everyone else sees — an economy that is stumbling again as the coronavirus surges back.

Delusions about the state of the economic recovery, in turn, allow conservatives to indulge in one of their favorite zombie ideas — that helping the unemployed in a depressed economy hurts job creation, by discouraging people from taking jobs.

Worrying about employment incentives in the midst of a pandemic is even crazier than worrying about those incentives in the aftermath of a financial crisis, but it seems to be at the core of White House thinking (or maybe that’s “thinking”) about economic policy right now.

One last thing: My sense is that Republicans have a delusional view of their own bargaining position. They don’t seem to realize that they, not the Democrats, will be blamed if millions are plunged into penury because relief is delayed; to the extent that they’re willing to act at all, they still imagine that they can extract concessions like a blanket exemption of businesses from pandemic liability.

Maybe the prospect of catastrophe will concentrate Republican minds, but it seems more likely that we’re heading for weeks if not months of extreme financial distress for millions of Americans, distress that will hobble the economy as a whole. This disaster didn’t need to happen; but you can say the same thing about most of what has gone wrong in this country lately."

The countries in Europe that got hit the hardest and had their hospitals overwhelmed were all national healthcare systems. They have higher deaths per capita then us and less ICU beds per capita. Our private healthcare system outperformed there's by a lot.

&gt;Contrary to President Donald Trump’s repeated claims that he inherited a Strategic National Stockpile with “empty” or “bare” cupboards, the federal government had more ventilators in stock than it ended up distributing amid the COVID-19 pandemic, FactCheck.org has learned.

&gt;The SNS had 16,660 ventilators “immediately available for use” when the federal government began deploying the breathing machines to states to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients in March, according to a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson.

1843,1843,1593276187,"This is a stupid post that instead of even trying to look at the overall picture with all data available, plucks out one example that seems to support the point it wants to make.  It turns out that one example, in context, is most likely just a coincidence, because a lot more examples contradict it than support it.  Overall, there's a noticeable correlation between places where reopening went too far, or where masks aren't being used, and rise in covid-19 cases, and there does *not* appear to be a correlation between whether or not a place had large BLM protests, and whether or not that area is seeing a covid-19 case rise.

People are trying to figure out what this means.  One possible lesson is that outdoor gatherings where the majority of people wear masks, don't cause a lot of spread.  We're still not sure but it seems plausible, and if it turns out to be true, will be very useful for responsible reopening.  Another possibility is just that the BLM protests were relatively few people when compared to the much larger number of people going to bars and restaurants and the like in places that are reopening irresponsibly, and also that places with large protests had businesses closing more and more people staying home, so there was actually *more* social distancing going on in the places with the biggest protests.  Or, it may be that both of these factors are real: protests increased social distancing, and outdoor gatherings where most people wear masks are low risk.  Or there may be something else going on.

But all of that aside, we can't learn from reality if we ignore reality, which is what this post does.  We won't figure out why BLM protests didn't cause a rise in cases, if we pretend they did cause it based on a cherry-picked coincidence."

1853,1853,1593079760,"I’m not sure but we are definitely seeing an upheaval of some kind. Bear with me as I’m going to start generalizing a fair bit here but... I think part of politics has broken away from the old left/right and class dichotomies. What we actually see now is driven by a different economic strata, a largely generational divide. 

I’d break it down into at least three groups: 1 baby boomer generation who have mostly retired. 2. Early Gen X who have seen economic good times probably got a house when they were affordable but are also impacting by the last decade or so of economic stagnation. 3. The rest of us, struggling to afford a down payment on mortgage if lucky . Thrown into the workplace during massive economic crisis  if unlucky.  

Just to add those who entered the workforce circa 2009 and again today will never recover their income levels. Throughout their entire career they will lag the incomes that those who worked in the latter half of the last century attained. Ironically going forward as the boomer generation passes their disposable income from pension income will evaporate from the economy. 

So here’s where I’m going to start generalizing. Group 1 thinks life’s just fine and group 3 is full of lazy moaners; they’re resistant to change. Group 2 thinks things ain’t what they used to be still fails to empathize with group 3; they want to return to the past. Group 1 in common with group 2 recognizes how messed up things have become economically; they seek progress towards something new. 

Of course to the back drop of this is the massive redistribution and inequality of wealth. graph of CEO salary to average worker here https://i.insider.com/57b21102db5ce953008b6c77?width=1100&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp So technically there is still class underpinnings here is just such a tiny upper class vs the masses. Divide and conquer always worked for them. 

At the same time we seem to have this split mostly between group 2 and 3 of individual desire vs collective responsibility. It’s most recent manifestation seems to be mask wearing to prevent the spread of COVID. Wearing a mask is an altruistic move it protects others way more than it protects you but that’s why everyone needs to do it for it to be effective. Of course it’s too much to ask some of group 2 it infringes their liberties to be obligated do something for others. Taken to its extreme masks are just political correctness and COVID a hoax for **me** to ignore.

Getting back to the point. that is how people are mostly split politically, by generation. It’s what can attract one group to a demagogue like Trump who will promise a return to the past while delivering none of it. While another group is pushed to the progressive left (and even the streets) who offer a genuine alternative (whether it would succeed or not).

Either way it will get worse before it gets better (can it get worse than depression level unemployment and a global pandemic?) the underlying issue is debt and its roots lie firmly in the 70s, Nixon, and the ending of Bretton Woods https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system#/media/File%3ABankingCrises.svg the only way to continue the kind of impressive and uplifting post war growth was to massively expand debt and some of the time it worked. It worked great in the 80s dragged us all the way to the tech bubble burst of 2000 but it doesn’t work anymore. These days it’s reached the point where it takes masses of debt just to keep an economy anaemic.

It can’t go on forever, we are probably reaching that proverbial point of pushing on a string. I don’t know the solution and I’m not sure how much 19th century political philosophy can really help us at this point. It may have predicted we’d get here but I’ll leave it up to others to decide whether it still offers the pathway out. So short answer yes I think we could be reaching that point of breakdown and what better place for it to happen than in a union of individual states.

Like I said a rant full of generalizations and I would like to point out my pride at all the middle aged and elderly women I saw on sixnineteen virtual events last weekend."
1854,1854,1593051381,"&gt;Every voting day in the U.S. is a holiday in The Church of Universal Suffrage. 

&gt;Started recently by a 27-year-old Nashville man, the new church takes the position that its members are eligible to vote by mail in Tennessee. Founder Timothy Jacobs said casting a ballot is on par with the rights listed in the Declaration of Independence, which is a key document for the church. 
""We basically believe that voting is also one of these unalienable rights endowed to us by our creator,"" said Jacobs, in a Monday interview with The Tennessean.

&gt;He launched the church as the legal fight over expanding absentee voting is heating up in Tennessee. The state recently appealed a Nashville judge's ruling that would allow any registered voter to cast their ballot by mail during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. 

&gt;Tennessee allows voters who meet certain criteria to request an absentee ballot.
People age 60 and older are among the groups eligible to vote by mail and so are those ""observing a religious holiday that prevents you from voting in person during the early voting period and on Election Day,"" says the Tennessee Secretary of State website.

&gt;An online discussion about the rules governing who can vote by mail in Tennessee inspired Jacobs to create The Church of Universal Suffrage. 
""I believe voter suppression is a sin because it is a right that was endowed to us by our Creator,"" Jacobs said in a follow-up email on Tuesday. ""This idea has existed for hundreds of years, but the idea to codify this belief into a religion came from the comments of Reddit."" 

&gt;On June 1, Jacobs registered The Church of Universal Suffrage as a nonprofit religious corporation with the Tennessee Secretary of State's Office. He also launched a website and a Facebook page for the church.
Weekly services where members meditate on voter suppression and corruption are held on Sundays. Holidays — every voting day in the U.S. — are observed by meditating on voter suppression, but also focusing on the celebration of voting rights. 

&gt;Services currently are online. All in-person services are canceled due to the COVID-19 outbreak and will likely stay that way until a vaccine is found, Jacobs said. The Church of Universal Suffrage had access to a physical space in an East Nashville business, he said.
No donations are accepted by the church. Instead, people are encouraged to support a local charity of their choice
The Church of Universal Suffrage now has thousands of members, according to a Tuesday post on the church's Facebook page. The website lists founding ministers in 20 states and one in Europe. 
""If any member of the church or minister urges or pressures another member to vote for a specific party or candidate, they are immediately banned from the church,"" Jacobs said. ""We consider voting to be a sacred right and that shouldn't be anything anyone is pressuring you to change.""

&gt;The church is being promoted online. A recent Reddit posts reads, ""Join the Tennessee Church of Universal Suffrage and legally vote by mail."" 
Voters can fill out a form to request an absentee ballot. They can chose from more than a dozen reasons for why they are eligible to vote by mail, including ""I am observing a religious holiday that prevents me from voting during early voting or on Election Day."" 

&gt;Jacobs recently requested an absentee ballot for the upcoming Aug. 6 election, he said. As of Monday, he was still waiting for his ballot to arrive.

Remember the GOP has always pushed back on voting rights, from the pushes for improved mail in voting (during Covid), to the expansion of the voting rights act before covid. 

Even the supreme court has been involved to help gerrymandering, it was challenged last year and now the conservative judges (majority) in the court ruled that its fine and dandy for lawmakers to define their states districts (thanks to Mitch preventing Obama from appointing) has ruled that "" gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts """

* That any of the above, if prevented, could have prevented ""most US deaths"" even though fewer than 10% of known covid-19 deaths in the US were in New York.

Even if you do have support for all of those claims, it of course doesn't obviate the article; faster US action would've prevented the need for New York to do better (and New York certainly could've done better than they did).  But I'm highly skeptical of your claim even on its own.

You didn't read the article or didn't bother to understand.  They're comparing outcomes in different countries, all of whom acted on the same information.

Yes, every President has been judged by how they handled a national crisis. Remember when Hurricane Katrina haunted the remaining three years of Bush’s presidency, because he failed to adequately respond?

And Trump didn’t just fail Covid, but failed the racial division issues too. Which is why his ratings are finally tanking imo. They began to go down a few months into lockdown and have steadily plunged lower since as he keeps failing every test that is thrown his way. And tries to distract us from them, but we won’t be distracted. 

He doesn’t understand these things, because he’s failed upwards his whole life and has never paid for his failures ever. This is what happens when a man-child is in charge of a country."

No. Presymptomatic and symptomatic spread still require contact tracing. Presymptomatic spread is the most dangerous.

They said other countries have experienced large scale epidemics before, but it’s a first for the US, so with that in mind the results aren’t that bad, Trump is dealing with a novel experience for people in the US. They see the riots as a net positive for him, saying that the vandalism and violence warrants a military response that so many public figures are too afraid to call for. They see Trump as the only leader on the right willing to call for military intervention and maintain law and order. They aren’t against the non-violent protests, I don’t think anyone really is. But the second they became violent and started damaging property, I had conservative friends texting me saying that this will ensure Trump gets re-elected. 

So left leaning people see Trump as partially responsible for the injustices perpetrated by police and others towards people of color. Right leaning people see Trump as the solution to the backlash of a mob in response to the killing of George Floyd by a rogue police officer.

I think the disconnect between the two parties is really shocking. They each have no idea of the thoughts and beliefs of the others, they each seem to be in their own echo chamber. I am a left leaning independent voter, but I try to at least make an effort to understand both parties, something that is increasingly hard to do. Echo chambers on social media and people only watching a single cable news network are to blame.

1902,1902,1591314096,"Yes, of course if you have asthma a respiratory irritant can be fatal, I never argued that, but the implication of the article, if read, is that exposure to tear gas will leave the victims largely vulnerable to a cornucopia of respiratory illnesses. If the article stopped at COVID (since it does have a fairly high rate of transmission), the implications would be within reason. 

The issue results from the implication that a single exposure is likely to compromise the immune systems of large portions of the populace to a large variety of viruses that can be life threatening. This is an exaggeration of the truth.  The vast majority of people exposed will be in pretty searing pain. The people saying it was as if their lungs were on fire was pretty accurate,  and I'm sure that a population that is not versed in the activating agent (i.e. heat) of tear gas will be prone to reactivating residue upon returning home.  They'll end up with a cough for a bit, but not much more.  Surprisingly enough, people tend to leave places that are doused in tear gas. 

Are there considerable outliers to this? Of course, but I don't think anyone is trying to hide that tear gas is bad for you. You can die from any kind of gas with enough exposure, and if it hurts to breathe it, it's probably going to take less of it to hit that point. 

I'm not saying the use of the gas in the instances it's being used are warranted. People that it's being used on have largely been protesting peacefully as police demonstrate the very behavior these people are protesting, and like I said, the risks the article mentions ARE NOT LIES, but they are exaggerated to trigger more outrage and push the author's intent.

The problem I have with it is there are plenty of more abhorrent reasons to want its use limited: 

1. A fairly large portion of our populace wears contact lenses, and tear gas can serve as a catalyst to bind polymers to mucal membranes (lens fused to eye), which can cause temporary and permanent blindness
2. The canisters come out fast and hot and they explode, launching shrapnel as they do so, and many of the officers I've seen use them don't seem intent on knowing what the canisters will land near, which can seriously maim or kill
3. It's an oddly first-resort countermeasure when the force is dramatically unequal to its opposition. Some barricades and good police work could prevent most of these people from creating a problem because, like I said, most of the protesters getting gassed are peaceful

Bottom line: The report is TRUE, but it's been exaggerated to push an agenda. There are some far more pressing threats of riot control that the news could be focusing on without exaggeration, but they have chosen this hill to die on instead. Exaggerating events to further a point is sensationalization. It's not lying, it's just exaggerating. It sews distrust within the opposition, and it will hurt a cause if the data is found to be slanted. However, if you want to see real threats, like shrapnel wounds and burns from tear gas implementation, look no further than the protesters from Standing Rock. If you want to see people blinded from wearing contacts during tear gas exposure, find some washouts from a police training program or from military training.

I want change because I'm tired of seeing people needlessly killed by police because I've been watching it on TV, and I've seen incidents like it happen in the very places I've lived, but all the evidence we need is in the plain truth. There's no exaggeration needed."

I also think some of those folks are more likely to cast their vote differently this November.

Everything was going great. We were cruising to reelection!” Even as the death toll neared 100,000 and unemployment ranks swelled to over 38 million, Trump couldn’t see the pandemic as anything other than something that had happened to him. “The problem is he has no empathy,” the adviser said. Trump complained that he should have been warned about the virus sooner. “The intelligence community let me down!” he said.

The White House declined to comment.

Trump’s outburst reflected his growing frustration that, at this stage of the race, he is losing to Joe Biden. According to a Republican briefed on the campaign’s internal polls, Trump is trailing Biden by double digits among women over 50 in six swing states. “Trump knows the numbers are bad. It’s why he’s thrashing about,” the Republican said.

Even those closest to Trump have been privately worried the election is slipping away. According to a source, Melania Trump warned the president during their trip to India in February to take the virus response seriously. “He totally blew her off,” the source said. Melania later told people that Trump “only hears what he wants to hear and surrounds himself with yes-people and family,” the source added."

OAKLAND, Calif. — Leaders of the embattled California Republican  Party are reversing course during the Covid-19 pandemic to demand Gov.  Gavin Newsom ban a voting practice they until recently endorsed.

The Republican leaders vowed to boost their “ballot harvesting”  efforts — to allow people to pick up and deliver absentee ballots that  others have cast — after a Democratic thumping in the 2018 midterms. But  they're now arguing that it's ""an intolerable risk to public health and  safety.""

 Ballot harvesting got so egregious in 2018 in North Carolina—where  it’s illegal (as it is in Texas)—that Republican Congressional candidate  Mark Harris saw his 905-vote victory [annulled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_North_Carolina%27s_9th_congressional_district_election) in early 2019, with a redo ordered. 

Mail-in ballot fraud is so pervasive in some parts of Texas that they  have a local name for those who broker election victories: [Politiqueros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afGzRhoHLs4&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8flCpd5De2lrxahqJxsMxc7HAV6FAtT9WgvZIL6WM0w5oX8p2HvA2E5tV00-xScMdZrw2B).  Unlike in North Carolina, there are rarely consequences for ballot  harvesters or the campaigns who hire them in the Lone Star State. 

 Patterson acknowledged in an interview that ballot harvesting “is  something that we did across our state to get our endorsed candidate  across the finish line’’ in some races for the March 3 primary. Still,  Patterson noted that “January was a very different time than we're  living in now … in a situation we’ve never been in before."" 

 Patterson’s new concerns are especially hypocritical — coming in the weeks  before voters in the CA-25 district will vote to fill Hill’s seat. The  contest in the swing district, which flipped Democratic in 2018, is  considered a tossup between Democratic Asssemblywoman Christy Smith and  Republican Mike Garcia.

  

In the Covid-19 pandemic, the best way, the healthiest, safest and  securest way to maintain integrity and elections is to do an all-mail  ballot election.

You can’t ask people to go stand and wait in line to vote,’ a move  that forced hundreds in Los Angeles to do just that in the March  primary. 

Standing in long lines is far more dangerous than ballot harvesting."

In a recent campaign[ ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmieUrXwKCc#action=share), Joe Biden accused the president of being too soft on China over COVID-19. This decision to criticize Donald Trump on China and subsequent signals that Biden will take a tough approach toward Beijing have made some progressives nervous.

Writing in *The Atlantic*, Peter Beinart[ called](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/futility-bidens-china-hawkery/610285/) Biden’s ad “a jingoistic fantasy” that may put Asian Americans in the crosshairs of racist attacks, “hastening a geopolitical confrontation that threatens progressive goals.” In *The New York Times*, the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft scholars Rachel Esplin Odell and Stephen Wertheim[ warned](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/opinion/china-coronavirus-trump.html) Biden about following Trump into a new cold war with China and argued that the United States should seek to work with Beijing on shared challenges such as pandemics and climate change.

Critics of Biden’s China policy are proposing far-reaching U.S.-China cooperation that Chinese President Xi Jinping’s recent diplomatic record suggests is chimerical at best. Yes, the United States should have a bilateral relationship with China and the two countries should cooperate on shared interests, including pandemics, but the proposition that a cooperative world lies just beyond the horizon if only the United States were to want it enough is not borne out by the evidence. And any progressive foreign policy needs to be based on a realistic assessment of China’s record.

Just ask the Europeans. Their experience proves that such cooperation has real limits and that China is constantly looking to exploit any perceived weakness or division. The European Union has no meaningful ability to counter Chinese power militarily. It is diplomatically cautious and hardwired to support engagement with Beijing. Its strategic assessments go out of their way to be nuanced and balanced. Last year, a key EU document[ said](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/communication-eu-china-a-strategic-outlook.pdf):

&gt;China is, simultaneously, in different policy areas, a cooperation partner with whom the EU has closely aligned objectives, a negotiating partner with whom the EU needs to find a balance of interests, an economic competitor in the pursuit of technological leadership, and a systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance.

Although this may sound as if the EU is trying to have it all ways with China, this wording was widely interpreted as a toughening of Europe’s position.

Even as the EU tried to formulate a united approach to protect against pressure from Beijing, it sought to distinguish itself from the United States with an ambitious and pragmatic policy agenda for cooperation with China. This year was supposed to see the first ever summit, in Leipzig, Germany, among the heads of government of all 27 EU member states and President Xi, with negotiations on a comprehensive EU-China investment agreement at its heart. When the coronavirus hit in January, the EU quietly assisted China and refrained from any criticism of its regime, in the hopes that doing so would build goodwill.

In other words, the official EU posture and the bloc’s practical policy toward China, even as it hardened, was far softer and more benign than any imaginable U.S. approach. European governments were going to great lengths to see if engagement would yield new levels of cooperation on shared challenges, but they were continuously and sorely disappointed.

Well before the COVID-19 crisis, EU governments were growing more and more worried about China’s behavior. They realized that while Chinese state-backed companies and funds aggressively increased their presence in Europe, China would not undertake structural economic reform to open up to Europe. Beijing sought to divide the EU, developing ties with Central and Eastern Europe while pressuring recipients of Chinese investment, such as Greece and Hungary, to block or stymie EU actions Beijing disapproved of on human-rights or investment controls. China also began to flex its muscles to mute any criticism of the regime by governments, companies, or individuals. For instance, the Chinese broadcaster CCTV[ refused](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/15/football/mesut-ozil-arsenal-china-uyghur-media-spt-intl/index.html) to air an English Premier League soccer match after an Arsenal player, Mesut Özil, spoke out against detention camps in Xinjiang. When Swedish PEN awarded a freedom-of-speech prize to the Chinese-born and Hong Kong–based Swedish citizen Gui Minhai, the Chinese embassy in Stockholm fiercely[ denounced](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/18/china-threatens-sweden-after-gui-minhai-wins-free-speech-award) it and warned that Sweden would “suffer the consequences.” These were not isolated incidents, and they gradually began to change European attitudes.

As Andrew Small, a scholar with the German Marshall Fund and European Council on Foreign Relations, shows in a new[ paper](https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/the_meaning_of_systemic_rivalry_europe_and_china_beyond_the_pandemic) on EU-China relations, Beijing further escalated these exploitation efforts once China could turn its attention away from the coronavirus. China sought to take economic advantage of Europe’s vulnerability during the pandemic by trying to buy European technology companies. Chinese ambassadors—nicknamed *Wolf Warrior* diplomats, after the nationalistic action movie—went on the offensive, accusing the French government of letting its elderly citizens die in nursing homes and of spreading the falsehood that the [U.S. Army had brought the virus to China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html). German officials complained that China was insisting on public declarations of support in exchange for its assistance.

1955,1955,1590097570,"Thank you for that information.  I stand corrected.  When I saw this verbiage in the Reuters article, I assumed that ""develop"" meant more than just building it working from someone else's recipe.

&gt;“They were told that the ‘emergency use authorization’ would be coming,  so hurry up and **develop the kits**,” said Lee Hyukmin, head of the  coronavirus task force at the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine,  who was at the meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

You are correct.  South Korea DID use the recipe provided by the WHO.  Unfortunately, that really doesn't change a thing about what happened here.

As the article you provided states:

&gt;*Instead of using the template approved by the World Health Organization,  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set out to create its  own test* [*from scratch*](https://www.propublica.org/article/cdc-coronavirus-covid-19-test)*, only to see that effort plagued by delay and dysfunction that continues to this day.*

And as [t](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/health/who-coronavirus-tests-cdc/index.html)he CNN article I linked states:

&gt;*On January 17, WHO published a protocol from German researchers with the instructions necessary for any country to manufacture coronavirus tests.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*That same day, a top US health official said that* ***the CDC had developed an early version of its own test -- not relying on any protocols published by the WHO***.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the test kits the CDC created were crap, the hospitals and private labs got tired of waiting and had to design their own..... which meant that the US FDA had to then approve those non-CDC tests.  As the Reuters article says:

&gt;*Then, sticking to its time-consuming vetting procedures,  the U.S. Food  and Drug Administration* ***didn’t approve tests other than the CDC’s until  Feb. 29****, more than five weeks after discussions with outside labs had  begun.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Meanwhile, in the absence of enough kits, the CDC insisted for weeks on  narrow criteria for testing, recommending it only when a person had  recently been to China or other hot spots or had contact with someone  known to be infected. As a result, the federal government failed to  screen an untold number of Americans and missed opportunities to contain  the spread, clinicians and public health experts say.*

So for more than 5 WEEKS we, waited for working test kits while this virus spread across our country.  So unless you expected him to **overrule his science experts** at the CDC and FDA, this critical loss of more than a month cannot be blamed on Trump"
1956,1956,1590092759,"Isnt that what is is currently doing ?

Ignore the advice of his CDC experts - yep hes doing that. Keep taking that unproven medication that has a history of causing heart problems in older men Mr. President !  What ya got to loose ?

Show no confidence in them - Trump retweeted #FireFauci so whats up with that ?

The Trump administration axed the executive branch team responsible for coordinating a response to a pandemic and did not replace it, eliminating Ziemer’s position and reassigning others, although Bolton was the executive at the top of the National Security Council chain of command at the time.

Despite ***months*** of alarms that the coronavirus was  lurking at our doorstep, the Trump administration failed to mount an  urgent response until the nation was engulfed and overwhelmed by the  pandemic.

“We had ample notice to get our country ready,” says Ron Klain, who  served as President Obama’s Ebola czar, and lists the rolling out of  testing, securing protective equipment, and building up hospital  capacity as necessary preventative steps. “We spent all of January and  February doing none of those things, and as a result, when this disease  really exploded  in March, we weren’t prepared.”

 Defeating an invisible enemy like the coronavirus requires working  diagnostics. But when the CDC’s original test kit failed, there was no  Plan B. The nation’s private-sector biomedical establishment is  world-class, but the administration kept these resources cordoned behind  red tape as the CDC foundered. Precious weeks slipped by — amid  infighting, ass covering, and wasted effort — and the virus slipped  through the nation’s crippled surveillance apparatus, taking root in hot  spots across the country, and in particular, New York City.

The mismanagement cost lives. With adequate testing from the  beginning, says Dr. Howard Forman, a Yale professor of public-health  policy, “we would have been able to stop the spread of this virus in its  tracks the way that many other nations have.” Instead, says Sen.  Murray, the administration’s response was “wait until it’s too late, and  then try and contain one of the most aggressive viruses that we’ve ever  seen.”

Blind to the virus’s penetration and unable to target mitigation  where it was needed, the administration and state governors had to  resort to the blunt instrument of shuttering the economy, says Dr.  Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. And the  lack of testing kept us in limbo. “Our economy is shut down because we  still do not have adequate testing,” Jha says. “We have been woefully  behind from the beginning of this pandemic.”

If the president’s deputies made trillion-dollar mistakes,  accountability for the pandemic response lies with Trump, who waived off  months of harrowing intelligence briefings, choosing to treat the  coronavirus as a crisis in public relations, rather than a public-health  emergency. Having staked his re-election on a strong economy, Trump  downplayed the virus.

 

**The front-line agency** built to respond to a  pandemic, the CDC, was placed in unreliable hands. Dr. Robert Redfield  is a right-wing darling with a checkered scientific past. His 2018  nomination was a triumph for the Christian right, a coup in particular  for evangelical activists Shepherd and Anita Smith, who have been  instrumental in driving a global AIDS strategy centered on abstinence.

Redfield’s tight-knit relationship with the Smiths goes back at least  three decades, beginning when Shepherd Smith recruited him to join the  board of his religious nonprofit, Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy  (ASAP). The Smiths made their views plain in the 1990 book *Christians in the Age of AIDS,*  which argued HIV infection resulted from “people’s sinfulness,” and  described AIDS as a consequence for those who “violate God’s laws.”  Redfield, a devout Catholic who was then a prominent HIV researcher in  the Army, wrote the introduction, calling for the rejection of “false  prophets who preach the quick-fix strategies of condoms and free  needles.”

 

Redfield’s Army career derailed after he was accused of “sloppy or,  possibly, deceptive” research for touting a trial HIV therapy that later  proved useless. An investigation found no wrongdoing, but called out  his “inappropriately close” relationship with Shepherd Smith, who also  hyped the drug. Redfield insisted there was “no basis for any of the  allegations,” but the scandal spurred his departure to a research lab at  the University of Maryland.

Still, Redfield’s résumé — religious-right bona fides, a military  background, and a knack for ingratiating himself with powerful people —  primed his return to government. “Over the years, there have been  several attempts to push him into powerful slots within Republican  administrations,” says Garrett. “I don’t think most of his promoters  have ever been particularly interested in the science.”

When his CDC appointment was announced in March 2018, Sen. Murray  warned of Redfield’s “pattern of ethically and morally questionable  behavior,” as well as his “lack of public-health expertise,” and urged  Trump to “reconsider.” But the CDC post does not require Senate  approval.  

Charlie Baker of Massachusetts had a shipment of medical equipment  seized at customs by FEMA, and was forced to rely on a private plane,  owned by the New England Patriots, to fly in a shipment of masks from  China. In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan resorted to buying 500,000  coronavirus tests from South Korea and stashing them in an undisclosed  location under watch by the National Guard.

Frieden, the former CDC chief, says that what’s required to contain  the pandemic — and begin reopening the economy — is a “box it in”  approach, with four components: widespread testing; isolating positive  cases; contact tracing to identify people likely to have been infected;  and quarantining those same people. The White House put this strategy  into practice after a top aide to the vice president, Katie Miller,  tested positive, and several Coronavirus Task Force members, including  Redfield and Hahn, put themselves in quarantine on May 9th.



Rolling out this practice nationally would be a sophisticated  undertaking, requiring coordination that had not, into May, materialized  from the White House. After failing to provide anything more than a  gesture at a framework for reopening in late April, the administration  began pushing states to rev up their economies. It did this despite  internal CDC projections that COVID-19 deaths were on track to hit 3,000  a day by June 1st, while blocking release of a science-based CDC  playbook for opening schools, restaurants, churches, and mass transit.

Sen. Murray says Trump and Pence have abdicated their responsibility  in this crisis: “No one is putting together a plan!” She recalls a  recent conversation with Pence. “He couldn’t even tell me how many tests  they need. If you don’t have a goal, how do you produce it?” Experts  believe the country needs a minimum of 1 million tests a day to safely  reopen; through April, it rarely exceeded 200,000 a day.

Sebelius, herself a former governor of Kansas, insists that it is  mission-critical for the United States to begin acting like the *United*  States. “We absolutely have to have a plan of what happens between now  and when we finish a national vaccination campaign,” Sebelius says. “If  every state is on their own trying to figure this out, we’ll have a  total nightmare.”

In the event that Trump is still president when a vaccine becomes  available, Sebelius argues that the loose confederations that have  formed in the Northeast, Midwest, and Pacific states to coordinate their  reopenings may need to band together in a shadow government to sidestep  Trump. “Maybe governors will put together their own system,” she says,  “and ignore what’s happening in the White House.”"

During a Feb. 28, 2020, campaign rally in South Carolina, President  Donald Trump likened the Democrats' criticism of his administration's  response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach  him, saying ""this is their new hoax.""

And that is that unless  you have an immune system that’s compromised and you are older and you  have other underlying health issues, you are not going to die, 99%, from  this virus, correct?”

Collins (Trump-GA) is not a physician but he validated Hannity’s cavalier attitude. “That’s correct, Sean,” he said.

HANNITY #1: Alright, so that’s the point. **I mean, this scaring the living hell out of people -- I see it, again, as like, oh, let's bludgeon Trump with this new hoax.**

Trump [said](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6145728961001#sp=show-clips)  in a March 30 “Fox &amp; Friends” interview: “We inherited a broken  test. The whole thing was broken and we rebuilt it.” (There was, of  course, no inherited “test” for the new coronavirus .

Legum [stated](https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1232051346796371968)  in a follow-up tweet that “Trump also cut funding for the CDC, forcing  the CDC to cancel its efforts to help countries prevent  infectious-disease threats from becoming epidemics in 39 of 49 countries  in 2018. Among the countries abandoned? China.” That was partly true,  according to 2018 news [reports](https://web.archive.org/web/20200206210123/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/02/01/cdc-to-cut-by-80-percent-efforts-to-prevent-global-disease-outbreak/)  stating that funding for the CDC’s global disease outbreak prevention  efforts had been reduced by 80%, including funding for the agency’s  efforts in China.

But that was the result of the anticipated depletion of previously  allotted funding, not a direct cut by the Trump administration. And as  the CDC told [FactCheck.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20200314145657/https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/false-claim-about-cdcs-global-anti-pandemic-work/), the cuts were ultimately avoided because Congress provided other funding.

&gt; The shocking inflation of COVID-19 death numbers

COVID-19 deaths are likely [underreported](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-death-toll-us.html). Every state has a lot of excess deaths right now. A big chunk of that is likely COVID-19.

&gt; States with longer lockdowns had worse results

Also false. Oregon and Washington both have had long lockdowns. ORegon has maintained a relatively low case count. NYC, Washington and California all have managed to start decreasing [their case counts](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map). States without lockdowns are still experiencing a [rise in cases](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-coronavrus-largest-single-day-increase-covid-19-cases/).

&gt; Outside nursing homes, the fatality rate never warranted such action, even if it would work

That is largely a opinion that values economic activity more than 1% of the population's lives. That isn't a 'fact'. It is a value judgement.

&gt; Outside New York, this is barely worse than bad flu seasons

Wildly wrong. The most deaths ever recorded from the flu is 60k in a year. COVID-19 even outside NY only has already taken that many lives, and we are only a few months into this.

&gt; Excess deaths are from the lockdowns, not the virus

Here Horowitz tries to blame the excess deaths on anything except COVID-19. They cite another article that talks about [all the missed medical care](https://www.conservativereview.com/news/horowitz-bad-medicine-devastating-shocking-effects-covid-19-lockdown/) that could be causing these excess deaths. This is true. But they are comparing the numbers to 'pre-COVID'.

If these sick individuals sought medical care with these preexisting conditions by going to a medical system crowded with COVID-19, these patients are likely to end up sick and may die. This is the most vulnerable population and sending them into a pandemic is idiotic.

&gt; Social distancing was invented by a high-school kid and politicians, not scientists

This is so dumb it hurts. The idea of social distancing, lock-downs and quarantines have been in [place for a hundred years](https://virus.stanford.edu/uda/fluresponse.html) or more. Most of the very effective techniques used in Asian countries were developed after the SARS outbreak.

1978,1978,1589817872,"&gt;*I can compare them, there is a reason ""we were on top of them from day 1.""  That reason is competent leadership.*

Bullshit.  Our CDC sure as hell weren't waiting on ""leadership"" from Obama in order to respond to H1N1.  They were notified by the hospitals immediately... THAT'S why they were on top of it so soon.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Whether it was having the right appointees working with WHO....*

We didn't have to rely on **anything** from the WHO for H1N1... they were relying on us.... just like they were relying on China.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*... or having agents on the ground in places like China (which Trump got rid of) specifically for the purpose of tracking outbreaks.*

What does that have to do any of these other pandemics during Obama's terms?  Nothing.  And while the US CDC staff we have embedded with the Chinese has been reduced, there are still over a dozen of them still working there.  Why didn't any of them warn us.... hmm?  The media asked CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield  about that one one position (Dr. Linda Quick) who was over there training Chinese field epidemiologists.  He said that her no longer being there  ""had absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier.”

 

&gt; To having a pandemic response team set up, which Trump inherited and  fired the majority of, and then put the others into a different  position. 

That response team didn't even exist until 2015... AFTER H1N1.  Obama did the same thing Trump did.  During Obama's administration, his national-security adviser (Susan Rice) eliminated and reorganized the  following directorates: 

* 2013–2014: The Community Partnerships Directorate (COMMPART), Arms Control &amp; Nonproliferation section of the Coordinator for Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate (NONPRO), and Office of the Vice President, National Security Affairs OVP-NSA).
* 2014–2015: The Defense, Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction, and Arms Control Directorate (DEFWMD).
* 2015–2016: The Afghanistan-Pakistan Directorate (AFPAK), Arms Control &amp; Nonproliferation Directorate (ARMSCONTROL), and Ebola Response Directorate (EBOLARESPONSE).
* 2016–2017: The Development Policy for Food Security (DEVDEM) and Multilateral Affairs &amp; Human Rights Directorate (MULTILAT).

So did that leave us ""totally unprepared"" for arms control and WMD?  Of course not.  There is so much overlap in these departments, it's disgusting.

 Everyone parrots this ""pandemic response team"" talking point, but nobody seems to know what they would have done any different than the COVID response team Trump put together.

Are you seriously saying that Trump calling the Democrats' trashing his COVID response their new ""hoax"" had **ANY effect** on the way the CDC, FDA, HHS, etc. performed their jobs?  Are these people professionals or not?

Obama's ""great leadership"" didn't SAVE us from these other pandemics.  They were never even close to COVID."

I buy it, they move in and they start work. Five to seven years later, they own it free and clear.

In a lawsuit filed by a nonprofit group, Washington League for Increased Transparency and Ethics (WASHLITE), Fox News has been accused of violating Washington State’s Consumer Protection Act by falsely stating in February and March broadcasts that the novel coronavirus was a hoax, downplaying the crisis in a way that potentially undermined efforts to slow the spread of the disease. While many might dismiss this lawsuit in the same manner that Fox News has, it presents interesting questions of law for news outlets.

The lawsuit, originally reported on by the Times of San Diego last week, is proceeding under the Washington State Consumer Protection Act (CPA), which provides: “Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.” That Act permits injunctive relief and payment of a civil penalty for violations. Notably, the Act has a reference to television broadcasting stations saying that it does not apply to those entities that distribute information “in good faith without knowledge of its false, deceptive or misleading character.” 

The lawsuit cites two examples of misconduct, though untold others may be uncovered and introduced as supporting evidence. One example involved Fox News personality Sean Hannity saying, “They’re scaring the living hell out of people, and I see it as, like, ‘Oh, let’s bludgeon Trump again with this new hoax.” The second example involved Trish Regan delivering a monologue next to a graphic that read, “Coronavirus Impeachment Scam.” In the monologue, Regan accused liberals of creating mass hysteria over the virus to shut down the economy and claimed that COVID-19 wasn’t as significant as other recent disease outbreaks such as SARS and Ebola.

Then there is this:

Fox News played an instrumental role in helping push the conspiracy theory that the 27-year-old Rich, who was murdered in a botched robbery in July 2016, had contact with Wikileaks, which released thousands of Hillary Clinton campaign emails during the 2016 presidential race.

The lawsuit describes a lurid and elaborate plot where a Fox News reporter, Malia Zimmerman, and guest commentator, Ed Butowsky, befriended the Riches and urged them to hire a private investigator, Rod Wheeler, without disclosing that he was a paid contributor to Fox News.* Without the Riches’ knowledge, the suit says Wheeler coordinated with Donald Trump’s White House and fed Fox News false information peddling the Wikileaks conspiracy theory, which resulted in a May 2017 Fox News story: “Slain DNC Staffer Had Contact with WikiLeaks Say Multiple Sources.”

Rich’s family asked Fox News to retract the story, which they did five days later. But Fox News guests and hosts like Sean Hannity continued to peddle the false story for months afterward. The Rich family then sued the network for “intentional infliction of emotional distress.”

The Second Circuit panel found that Rich’s parents’ allegations “plausibly rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct” by Fox News, who subjected the family to “a deliberate and malicious campaign of harassment.”"

IOW, had critical cases exceeded the medical equipment needed to treat those cases, the death rate would have been higher, guaranteed.

In the long run, it's impractical to try to have most people avoid being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The goal remains keeping critical cases below the level of medical equipment needed to treat those cases AND, with the value of hindsight, maintain adequate levels of PPE and avoid overstressing healthcare workers. Just remember: if critical cases exceed available medical equipment (and personnel), the death rate does increase.

Agreed the economy needs to open up slowly and in phases. It'd be nice if there were a federal government willing to provide guidance it'd stand behind. However, that entails *responsibility*, and that's something the current federal administration will flee from at all costs. Only credit, never blame for Trump."

The  guidance comes after the release of Tennessee's COVID-19 election  contingency plan, which was prepared by the state Division of Elections,  dated April 23, and provided this week to the AP.

The  plan doesn’t contemplate a shift to allow all voters to cast ballots by  mail due to fears of contracting or unknowingly spreading COVID-19 at  the polls. Republican Secretary of State Tre Hargett has contended that  would be a huge change in a short time frame for a state accustomed to  voting in person.

[Here](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19) is the WHO's own timeline of their response to the outbreak. I'm going to give you a hand here because it's 99.9999% percent certain that the source of your 'information' didn't refer to what the WHO actually said. They don't *want* you to look for yourself. Can I say ""why"" ? 

The [relevant statement](https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/) that the liars have twisted and misrepresented was made on January 5. The WHO **never** said the disease ""couldn't"" be transmitted from person to person. Of course **all** respiratory viruses **can** be transmitted even though there is a great variation in the ease of contagion. 

Here is the most relevant paragraph. I have added (!)s at certain points to emphasize the difference between what was actually said and what the liars *claim* was said.

&gt;According to the authorities, some patients were operating dealers or vendors in the Huanan Seafood market. Based on the preliminary (!) information from the Chinese investigation team, no evidence of significant (!) human-to-human transmission and no health care worker infections have been reported (! this was true at the time even though it was only 3 days later that Dr. Li Wenliang  became ill).


Now, if you'd like an other timeline for comparison to that of the WHO there are many available. Here is [one](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/rolling-stone-timeline-coronavirus-america-982944/). There are others that are even more damning."

2025,2025,1589044254,"&gt; So there are people who believe there was something more Trump could have done to prevent any deaths from this?

Waving hand -- I'm one of those people! There are *many* things traitor Trump could have done!

How far back do you want to go? In 2018 he killed the Obama-created Pandemic Response Team as a budget-saving move -- raw stupidity to save money for the increase in the deficit that Trump's massive tax cuts created.

At the time our clown [president said](https://www.govexec.com/management/2020/03/trump-defended-cuts-public-health-agencies-video/163872/), ""I’m a business person, I don’t like having thousands of people around when you don’t need them.""

That was pretty stupid in hindsight, huh?!

Today we have a ""pandemic response team"" headed up by the president's *unqualified son-in-law* -- a family yes-man -- not by dispassionate professionals.

But that's ""ancient"" history. Let's take this year.

Trump decided to MAGA the COVID-19 test. The president insisted on an American-made test and he actually *rejected* the German-invented WHO test that much of the rest of the world uses. That wasted *weeks* of precious time.

Trump's strategy has been not to do much testing. That's great for political PR since it makes our numbers *seem* low -- but it's a disaster for health and people's lives. Trump has falsely mis-represented our number, saying blatantly stupid **lies** like February's, “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.” Everyone knew that was BS coming from our braggart president's mouth.

Rather than taking it seriously, Trump played politics with the disease -- remember the Democrats' ""hoax"" line?

For critical weeks Trump deliberately downplayed the disease. FOX News echoed that propaganda so badly FOX is being sued over misleading the public and not performing its FCC-requirement of telling the truth and broadcasting in the public's interest.

And Trump *continues* with this propaganda today!

He urges fascist-like, armed intimidation/resistance of  to his own gov'ts guidelines of when states should restart their economies. (?!) In the past week he's touted some BS about how the virus is going to magically ""disappear"" -- while in the same week talking about how we need to get ready for 3000 deaths each day.

That seems to be Trump's strategy -- talk trash, take many sides of a particular issue, then when one becomes reality bombastically claim he predicted it correctly because he said that!

How can any sober-minded, rational person take such a clown president seriously?

The US is now the tragic laughingstock of the world -- 3000 deaths *per day!* Our int'l reputation is going down the crapper as we rack up 10s of thousands of American dead and doctors *still* scream about not enough testing (and testing has proven the key in countries successfully fighting the virus).

I could go on, but you asked what he could have done differently -- the above is a brief summary.

&gt; NYC has a completely out of line death rate compared to the rest of the nation and yet guys like Cuomo are heros...

NYC's hospital system simply broke down -- at times several hospitals were turning away sick people who went home to die. And all as the US Navy's hospital ship sat nearly empty!

Cuomo was able to look good because Cuomo is liked and is supported by a majority of NYC residents.

Trump, on the other hand, is divisive and is hated by many. Trump is an illegitimate president who was rejected by most voters in 2016 and has never had a mainstream public opinion poll showing a majority of Americans support him as president -- think about that! Trump has **no mandate** from ""we the people.""

Add to that Trump's lack of leadership and it's easy for Cuomo to ""look good"" -- **no matter how good or how bad** of a job Cuomo and the NYC mayor has done.

Add to that their **public** feuding and twitter wars with Trump and overall the US' political leadership is nothing short of an embarrassment in this crisis!"

So, we’ll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That’s pretty powerful.""

The article is about loneliness in general, and does not say that loneliness is exacerbated or made more common by social distancing. In fact, the underlying cause of maladies linked to loneliness is identified as "" maladaptive social cognition"", not time spent physically apart from other people.

Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive  600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. 
Untreated patients from another center were included as negative controls. 
20 cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral levels at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination.
Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is 
significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin,

In 80 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin we noted a clinical improvement in all but one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74 year still in ICU. A rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load tested by qPCR was noted, with Virus cultures from patient respiratory samples turning negative in 97.5% patients at Day 5. 
This allowed patients to rapidly be discharged from highly contagious wards with a mean length of stay of five days.

A review was made of six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and these clinical trials done in China. 
 
Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

Chloroquine is a long-established prescription drug that is often used clinically to treat malaria and connective tissue diseases. The antimalarial drug Chloroquine phosphate which has already been approved is confirmed to have an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect and has been included in diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. However, awareness of the risk of chloroquine phosphate causing acute poisoning or even death should be strengthened. The dosage used according to current clinical recommended dosage and course of treatment are larger than that of previous treatment of malaria. Many provinces have required close clinical monitoring of adverse reactions. This paper reviews the pharmacological effects, poisoning and toxicological mechanisms, in vivo metabolism and distribution, and forensic issues of chloroquine drugs, in order to provide help to forensic practice and clinical work

&gt;Fauci was involved in the decision to send US taxpayer funding to the Wuhan Research lab, so he may be covering his own behind in dismissing coronavirus originated there.

You have evidence of this, of course. Fauci has been the top epidemiologist at the CDC since Reagan was president. So you wouldn't be accusing him of covering up a Chinese plot to kill tens of thousands of Americans unless you had some evidence, right?

On one side, you have a guy who said we should see if drinking bleach would cure people of the coronavirus, and the collection of toadies, political hacks, and paranoid lunatics that he surrounds himself with. On the other, you have the entire medical establishment, not just in the US but in all of West Europe, Japan, Australia, and Canada as well.

Mr. Bleach and his cronies badly fucked up America's response to the epidemic, and tens of thousands of Americans have died and will continue to die as a result. They have no evidence that COVID-19 was created as a bioweapon, but with an election around the corner, they have a powerful motive to find someone besides themselves to blame for the most deadly fuckup that any US president has ever made, including the Vietnam War.

The world medical community warned the world about the virus, and they warned us early. The countries that listened, like South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand, and Germany, have already managed to contain the outbreak. The countries that didn't, like Italy, Brazil, the US, and the UK, have had horrific death tolls and are still struggling to contain the outbreak. The medical community has no motivation to deflect blame or to do anything except provide the public with the best information that they available to them.

Given those facts, every reasonably intelligent person is going to put the burden of proof on President Bleach and his cronies when they say that the doctors and researchers don't know what they're doing, or are covering up for the Chinese.

2048,2048,1588589283,"This Op-Ed has been posted multiple times. But it's worth reading. Someone copy-pasta'd from the website, and I formatted it:

*Here is a brilliant Op-Ed From Irish Times writer, Fintan O’Toole. April 25, 2020 (edit: formatting)*

**THE WORLD HAS LOVED, HATED AND ENVIED THE U.S. NOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE PITY IT**

Over more than two centuries, the United States has stirred a very wide range of feelings in the rest of the world: love and hatred, fear and hope, envy and contempt, awe and anger.

But there is one emotion that has never been directed towards the US until now: pity.

However bad things are for most other rich democracies, it is hard not to feel sorry for Americans. Most of them did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016.

Yet they are locked down with a malignant narcissist who, instead of protecting his people from Covid-19, has amplified its lethality. The country Trump promised to make great again has never in its history seemed so pitiful.

Will American prestige ever recover from this shameful episode?

The US went into the coronavirus crisis with immense advantages: precious weeks of warning about what was coming, the world’s best concentration of medical and scientific expertise, effectively limitless financial resources, a military complex with stunning logistical capacity and most of the world’s leading technology corporations.

Yet it managed to make itself the global epicentre of the pandemic. As the American writer George Packer puts it in the current edition of the Atlantic, “The United States reacted ... like Pakistan or Belarus – like a country with shoddy infrastructure and a dysfunctional government whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering.”

It is one thing to be powerless in the face of a natural disaster, quite another to watch vast power being squandered in real time – wilfully, malevolently, vindictively.

It is one thing for governments to fail (as, in one degree or another, most governments did), quite another to watch a ruler and his supporters actively spread a deadly virus.

Trump, his party and Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News became vectors of the pestilence. The grotesque spectacle of the president openly inciting people (some of them armed) to take to the streets to oppose the restrictions that save lives is the manifestation of a political death wish.

What are supposed to be daily briefings on the crisis, demonstrative of national unity in the face of a shared challenge, have been used by Trump merely to sow confusion and division. They provide a recurring horror show in which all the neuroses that haunt the American subconscious dance naked on live TV.

If the plague is a test, its ruling political nexus ensured that the US would fail it at a terrible cost in human lives. In the process, the idea of the US as the world’s leading nation – an idea that has shaped the past century – has all but evaporated.

Other than the Trump impersonator Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, who is now looking to the US as the exemplar of anything other than what not to do?

How many people in Düsseldorf or Dublin are wishing they lived in Detroit or Dallas?

It is hard to remember now but, even in 2017, when Trump took office, the conventional wisdom in the US was that the Republican Party and the broader framework of US political institutions would prevent him from doing too much damage.

This was always a delusion, but the pandemic has exposed it in the most savage ways.

**Abject surrender**

What used to be called mainstream conservatism has not absorbed Trump – he has absorbed it.

Almost the entire right-wing half of American politics has surrendered abjectly to him.

It has sacrificed on the altar of wanton stupidity the most basic ideas of responsibility, care and even safety. Thus, even at the very end of March, 15 Republican governors had failed to order people to stay at home or to close non-essential businesses.

In Alabama, for example, it was not until April 3rd that governor Kay Ivey finally issued a stay-at-home order.

In Florida, the state with the highest concentration of elderly people with underlying conditions, governor Ron DeSantis, a Trump mini-me, kept the beach resorts open to students travelling from all over the US for spring break parties.

Even on April 1st, when he issued restrictions, DeSantis exempted religious services and “recreational activities”.

Georgia governor Brian Kemp, when he finally issued a stay-at-home order on April 1st, explained: “We didn’t know that [the virus can be spread by people without symptoms] until the last 24 hours.”

This is not mere ignorance – it is deliberate and homicidal stupidity.

There is, as the demonstrations this week in US cities have shown, plenty of political mileage in denying the reality of the pandemic.

It is fuelled by Fox News and far-right internet sites, and it reaps for these politicians millions of dollars in donations, mostly (in an ugly irony) from older people who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus.

It draws on a concoction of conspiracy theories, hatred of science, paranoia about the “deep state” and religious providentialism (God will protect the good folks) that is now very deeply infused in the mindset of the American right.

Trump embodies and enacts this mindset, but he did not invent it.

The US response to the coronavirus crisis has been paralysed by a contradiction that the Republicans have inserted into the heart of US democracy.

On the one hand, they want to control all the levers of governmental power.

On the other they have created a popular base by playing on the notion that government is innately evil and must not be trusted.

The contradiction was made manifest in two of Trump’s statements on the pandemic: on the one hand that he has “total authority”, and on the other that “I don’t take responsibility at all”.

Caught between authoritarian and anarchic impulses, he is incapable of coherence.

**Fertile ground**

But this is not just Donald Trump.

The crisis has shown definitively that Trump’s presidency is not an aberration.

It has grown on soil long prepared to receive it. The monstrous blossoming of misrule has structure and purpose and strategy behind it.

There are very powerful interests who demand “freedom” in order to do as they like with the environment, society and the economy.

They have infused a very large part of American culture with the belief that “freedom” is literally more important than life.

My freedom to own assault weapons trumps your right not to get shot at school.

Now, my freedom to go to the barber (“I Need a Haircut” read one banner this week in St Paul, Minnesota) trumps your need to avoid infection.

Usually when this kind of outlandish idiocy is displaying itself, there is the comforting thought that, if things were really serious, it would all stop. People would sober up.

Instead, a large part of the US has hit the bottle even harder. And the president, his party and their media allies keep supplying the drinks.

There has been no moment of truth, no shock of realisation that the antics have to end.

No one of any substance on the US right has stepped in to say: get a grip, people are dying here.

That is the mark of how deep the trouble is for the US – it is not just that Trump has treated the crisis merely as a way to feed tribal hatreds but that this behaviour has become normalised.

When the freak show is live on TV every evening, and the star is boasting about his ratings, it is not really a freak show any more.

For a very large and solid bloc of Americans, it is reality. And this will get worse before it gets better.

Trump has at least eight more months in power. In his inaugural address in 2017, he evoked “American carnage” and promised to make it stop.

But now that the real carnage has arrived, he is revelling in it. He is in his element. As things get worse, he will pump more hatred and falsehood, more death-wish defiance of reason and decency, into the groundwater.

If a new administration succeeds him in 2021, it will have to clean up the toxic dump he leaves behind.

If he is re-elected, toxicity will have become the lifeblood of American politics.

Either way, it will be a long time before the rest of the world can imagine America being great again.

Just because your system is broken beyond repair does not mean it is broken elsewhere. Ours could be much improved, but it is miles better than yours when it comes to having the middle-class represented.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Your tribe is right and if only you'd just elected them, somehow THEY  will fix it all.  THEY won't be swayed by money, power and influence.

No, I am not saying that: make the rules so that any corruption or bribery gets you immediately fired and barred from exercising a public function and have rigorous control over it. Have the judicial system adjudicate that (which means that you also have to ensure your judges are not corrupt.

On corruption or civil servants: I have to turn over my revenue declaration and records to my institution every year, so that they can verify I am not getting any money from a place I am not supposed to. Should they discover anybody in the institution has ""forgotten"" to do that and their arse will be on the pavement before long.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Small government works because the government doesn't have enough power to make sweeping changes.

And they will have no power to counter a bigger entity which would try to mess with its workings (corporation, other State).

By the way, you will have local politicians get bribed by businesses. How do you intend to counter that? With the Second amendment rights that you have never used in a meaningful way to keep your politicians in line?

I suspect you do not intend to. And somehow, you do not care...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  A small government only has the power to guide, prod and suggest. 

Oh, I am sure corporations will be delighted to take your suggestion that they should not fuck over their workers, as they did in the meat-packing plants, as they did on the oil-drilling platforms (where they gleefully cut back on security, because ""muh profits!""), as they [expose their employees to environmental hazards](https://www.ishn.com/articles/110493-two-companies-earn-massive-fines-for-osha-violations). I am also sure they will take all precautions [not to pollute the groundwater when they frack](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fracking-can-contaminate-drinking-water/).

Small government does not work because it becomes less powerful than entities driven by greed (not completely their fault that is their whole raison d'être, although it takes a good dose of sociopathy for the people at the helm to simply fuck over the communities where they are implanted). So, while you will counter that ""the judiciary will intervene"", there are a couple of issues with your whole plan:

\- damages will be low compared to the profits they brought in by ignoring the safety of workers and citizens. See Purdue Pharma, see the tobacco industries, see the asbestos industry, see the fossil fuel indsutries, for what concerns climate change.

\- the judiciary is a part of government. So, you do not want government to interfere a priori, but you do not mind them interfering as long as a profit has been made, but somebody has been hurt in the process. By the way, if the government is ""small"", that means the judiciary is, as well, with the limited powers that come with that size, then what are the odds a major corporation will simply give it a middle finger and move on elsewhere?

\- finally, it is all nice and fun, but in the meantime people will have been hurt, maybe even killed. Fat lot of good that does them that their widow will get a pithy as damages. Absolutely great to get a few grands when they are crippled and cannot get another job because of it. You just do not give a shit about people, you are perfectly fine with sacrificing them, because we should not interfere with the economy. Screw that noise, the economy is just a tool at the service of people. If it needs to kill people to function, it is not working properly.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;These days, they just print it.  Hello?  The Fed?  Hello!

Hello! The European Central Bank does not work like that! And yet, Europe does not fare so badly. European States have to limit their losses. The US can afford to pull that sort of tricks, because the dollar is the reference currency.

By the way, corporations do not have to limit their losses. [Tesla has not made a profit in all of its existence](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113987/tesla-q4-2019-earnings-results-profit-revenue-model-3). Trump has declared bankruptcy multiple times, because, as you have said, it is just a trick, at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No, I'm pretty sure all those meat packing business just bought each  other up due to the high regulation that drove out the small farmer.

Then please explain why [France has a higher number of farms per capita](https://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/France-AGRICULTURE.html) (average size: 135 acres) than [the USA](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/05/06/state-of-american-farming-big-producers-dominate-food-production.html) (average size 443), despite being more centralised AND more regulated? If your argument held, there should be less farms per capita in France, as they would have concentrated.

Once again, you are mixing up centralisation, regulation AND concentration. You can have lax regulations in a highly centralised State (Vietnam), strict regulations in a decentralised State (Germany) and strict regulations in a highly centralised State (France).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Or maybe the magic people you imagine that live in Europe who have risen  about bribes and ego and all human vices will fly here on their angelic  wings to save us.

Nah, we will leave you to deal with the shit you have brought onto yourselves. Unfortunately, you are exporting your influence all over the world, so we have to make do with the havoc you wreak.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Absolutely nothing to do with my point.

To quote you: ""sez you"". It has everything to do with your point. You claim that you have to take a risk to make the industry work. Are you willing to take it? You have been clamoring that you do not want to force anybody to do anything against their will, but you want to send workers back to get infected (because corporations are just too damn greedy to provide protection for their workers and cut their profits to do that.). Uphold your principles. Volunteer. Get vocational training and get to work in one of these plants. They are aching for workers.

But somehow, you are willing to risk their lives, rather than either demand corporations provide protection and adapt their working conditions, or skip on your bacon and try to find alternative food supplies.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Again, the Road to Hell is paved with good intentions.  A lesson you  seemed determine to ignore.  How is the EU's open border policy working  out these days?

Not too bad, actually, because we have taken coordinated measures to shut the borders and ensure that contamination mitigation measures are in place. We have [1.5 million cases for 450 million citizens](http://www.rfi.fr/en/europe/20200502-the-number-of-covid-19-cases-in-europe-passes-1-5-million).

Yeah right. Chile swung pretty far to the capitalistic side when Pinochet took power and its population was still very poor when they finally managed to get rid of him. Next you will claim that they simply did not go far enough, which is exactly what communists (the real ones, not the imagined ones Americans love to fantasise about) said when their economies went to shit.

When the US take a shit, the rest of the world has to pinch its nose. So, yes, even people abroad have a vested interest in what happens in the USA. Evangelicals consolidating power is not good news for atheists, pagans, homosexuals and everyone else they love to demonise, in the US and elsewhere.

2055,2055,1588516254,"“The U.S. saw 2,909 people die of Covid-19 in 24 hours, according to the data, which was collected as of 4 a.m. ET on Friday.”"
2056,2056,1588459504,"Thing is hospitalization and death rates make it clear COVID-19 isn't going to kill most of us. Yes, it could kill millions, especially if those millions all swamped healthcare facilities at the same time. It just won't kill tens of millions.

OTOH, the damage to the economy and to household finances are much more apparent and damn near certain to affect anyone without 6-figure unearned income. [And if a major share of that income comes from interest on loans issued or rents, it ain't all that certain either.]

This is a TRADE-OFF. If it were to cost 20% of GDP to save 100,000 lives, would it be worth it? That's a policy question, not a simple moral one, because the simple (simplistic) moral calculus in which no life can be monetarily denominated would demand we accept the destruction of the world economy to save one life.

Also, there may be no effective vaccine for years or ever. Just because lots of scientists and money are being thrown at the problem is no guarantee they'll succeed. Consider cold fusion for an analog. Would we embrace years-long stay-at-home to save lives and to Hell with the economy? No. At some point we may be forced to accept herd immunity as the only path forward, and that may need to be purchased by allowing natural selection to refine the human gene pool. Yes, cold-blooded, but a possibility which policy makers must consider."
2057,2057,1588455985,"While it may seem heartless, the US and world do need to reopen economic activity soon. That will lead to more deaths than would have occurred had stay-at-home orders been extended into the summer. OTOH, there'd be huge economic hardships which only those in their late 80s and older would have any chance of remembering 1st hand if the economy remained closed until summer.

This is a classic trade-off. Also, the only viable long-term solutions are an effective vaccine OR herd immunity deriving in part from natural selection. Yes, cold-blooded.

There was never a plan to spare as many people as possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Stay-at-home orders were only meant to slow the spread of the virus so that severe cases didn't overwhelm hospitals and other healthcare facilities. It's possible we may have done so IN SOME AREAS, but not all areas.

From my non-epidemiologist's perspective, Sutter and Yuba counties opening up may be OK given low case rates AND moderately sparse population density, but it's a gamble. Orange county opening its beaches is *at least an order of magnitude* stupider.

This may be Solomonic or foolish, but I figure it'd be far better to open businesses with their doors on streets/open air for at least 3 weeks before allowing ANY enclosed shopping malls to reopen. And even when malls did reopen, I'd PROHIBIT anyone under 15 years of age or impose $$ fines on parents who failed to keep their children near them. Children may be least at risk of COVID-19, but given their usual behavior, they could be among the most prolific spreaders of SARS-CoV-2."
2058,2058,1588454948,"I haven't read the whole letter yet, but I had to respond to the bit on antibody testing and orders of magnitude. Testing hasn't been a strength in the US on a per capita basis. If antibody testing is similarly sparse, data from it may be skewed. Also, it'd be useful to see the geographical map of where the antibody tests were collected. If mostly from northeast urban areas, not surprising they'd show considerably broader exposure to the virus vs confirmed and reported cases.

Step one in assessing the orders of magnitude claim would be getting a decent estimate of how many have been exposed to the virus but remained symptomatic as well as those who had only mild symptoms. The bulk of those people would likely not have been tested.

The more reliable data is hospitalizations and deaths. By those measures, COVID-19 is considerably worse than influenza, possibly excluding the 1918 Spanish Flu."
2059,2059,1588449040,"Um... the 1918 flu pandemic was [terrible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu), and arguably, fundamentally change the world power structure to this day.

COVID-19 could have half of that impact...  but that is still hugely significant. I don't see how that is a 'hoax' by any account."
2060,2060,1588407261,"""...remember history...""

Jesus, you're obsessed.  Just determined to wipe it all out and start clean, eh post modernist?  I shouldn't be surprised coming from a European bureaucrat.  No one looks at these statues and says to themselves, ""Gee!  Slavery must've been swell!""  History does not adhere to your perfect vision of what everyone should learn and in fact, it should not.  The world is not divided up into oppressors and oppressed.  I know you like to imagine we're full of soft-brained fatties over here, but I've traveled to the South many times.  It's suburban.  No fat racists in overalls playing banjos, just IT engineers and soccer moms mostly.

""Bail..."" 

Again, you can adjust it for a poor person.  The idea is to keep them from being a flight risk.  Poor people go to bail bondsman, where you only need 10%.  It depends on the judge, the jail, etc.  The problem is, the new rule allows the judge to assess you get NO bail, so you have no chance of getting out until you're cleared.  It's only discriminatory if the judge is.

""And you get an opioid overdose epidemic...""

Yeah, like the alcoholic epidemic when the legalized booze again.  Oh, wait...

I told you, the problem with the judicial system is the caps put on awards by Congress via regulating industry.  Remove the caps and you put people out of business.  BP had it's liability capped at $100 million during the oil spill, which is why they were willing to risk such a spill in the first place.  Regulation bad!

Part of the problem is this:  If you have a government that says, ""Don't worry, we have regulations to protect you.""  You get a populace that ASSUMES there's no risk.  For instance, in the U.S. people used to keep tabs on their bank.  They would be wary of putting their money in the bank because if it failed, you'd lose your money.  Then the FDIC was created to insure money up to $100K, now it's higher, $250K.  Sounds great, right?

The problem is, once you do that, none of the customers cared what the bank did.  And part of the problem with the banks is that they take wild chances on risky investment schemes with their customer's money.  But the customers don't care because they know they cannot lose their meager savings, so NO ONE checks on the bank, save the regulators, who are bad at it and can't be everywhere.

The same logic applies to drugs, food, etc.  People are no longer wary, they are entitled little bitches who throw a fit wherever they go.  It's part of the reason no one listened to me back in January when I told them to start wearing a mask.  The news told them they'd be fine and like the sheep they are, they believed it.  

You don't want people to die but to micromanage every aspect of industry is too much.  Yes, you go after the big dogs who hurt people, but there should be a healthy amount of chaos in the mix.  You should get your hand a little burned so you know not to touch the stove.

""Corbyn, communist?...""
https://i0.wp.com/www.creativededuction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/corbyn-commie.jpg?w=1280

Here's the problem with Socialists, they think it stops.  Even Marx (or one of the commie founding fathers) admitted Socialism was just a slow roll to Communism and it is.  

See, socialism doesn't work.  The moment you start putting on price controls and labor controls, you distort the marketplace until you drive people out of business. Now it's possible that the government will let up before it happens, prolonging things and hovering in stasis, between capitalism and socialism for a time.  But when you get as far along, as say Venezuela, things collapse and you're forced to nationalize everything or give up power.  

In socialism, there's no problem the government won't attempt to solve.  None.  And it just keeps accumulating tasks that it gets worse and worse at fixing until it breaks the government.  All the while, people keep lowering and lowering their expectations as they get poorer and poorer.

So Corbyn wouldn't START at Communism.  He starts with guaranteed housing and full unemployment, which he can't achieve without ridiculous amounts of power and then you quickly snowball into Communism because you ""have"" to.

Fortunately, Corbyn's been humiliated.  It was hilarious to watch.  Go UK!

""What elitism?...""

Racism is bad.  Being racist is bad, but it's not a permanent condition.  Ask Daryl Davis. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Davis

""Religion..""

Well, I'm not religious, but I think it's possible to be a religious person without being an asshole.  Separation of church and state and all...

""Then why is Trump...""

You don't understand the politics here.  You definitely don't understand Trump.  When you're a Republican, you do Republican things.  Just like when you're a Democrat, you do Democrat things.  In the GOP, you go to church and you acknowledge all the big holidays.  You say, ""God Bless the United States of America"".  When you're a Democrat, you visit ever marginalized group and make sure your staff is a rainbow of diversity.  It's all a show.

What you also have to understand is how every marginalized group in this country has it's own political organization.  Now most of these sprang out of the era of the Civil Rights Movement and the time right after.  And for decades, the won battles and they did some good.  But in 2020, they face a real problem...

People in the U.S. are way more tolerant now.  They just are.  I told you, you can't listen to our media.  (USA Today?  Seriously?)  ACLU aren't the crusading guys they once were.  In the past, they were on the left and that was okay because all the progressive were there.  Their fights were righteous and they did great things.

The problem now?  Over the last 20 years the lines have blurred.  The GOP is not jam packed full of rich, white racists.  They were under the gun from these groups for so many years and as the TV and Internet made scandals more instant, they simply purged everyone that had those scandals.

But the Democrats didn't do that.  They weren't under the same scrutiny.  The media is on THEIR side.  So guys like Robert Byrd https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd 
get the benefit of the doubt.  They're allowed to make amends.  They get a pass for their past.  While if the members of the GOP make so much as misspeak---  It's a huge scandal, blown up by the media to get rid of one those nasty Republicans.  After a time, the Republicans just kept purging until now, the Democrats have more problems.  The current Governor of Virginia caught in blackface in high school.  No way a Republican could survive that.  The media would howl until he was gone.  Because he's a Democrat, he's still in office.  Kavanaugh, gets called a gang rapist while the media gets to wildly speculate.  Biden, despite witness confirmation, his history of oddly touching people and his own hypocrisy---  The media is tripping all over itself to say there should be proof.

That double standard is real.  But the BIG problem is, the Democrats would always run on two things: helping the working man and ending discrimination.  Helping the working man went out the window when they outsourced most of the factory job to China in the early 90's.  It officially ended when Hillary ran in 2016 and she blew off major dinners with groups connected to workers.  (Despite her husband's warnings.)  The Democrats are now the party of Goldman Sachs.

As for discrimination?  It's mostly gone.  Companies are petrified of getting caught up in a lawsuit.  The incidents you see in our media are so obscure and so far afield, you have to dig deep to find them now.  (50 years ago, not the case)  What we have is an uptick in FAKE racist and homophobic attacks.  What we have is a moral panic where people see that stuff everywhere.  Like when Sarah Silverman took pictures of ""nazi symbols"" and posted them online, only to find out they were just markings for the construction workers who were fixing sewer pipes in her neighborhood.

So, circling back---  Groups like the ADL, ACLU and many others---  They're hurting for donors because they've simply outlived their usefulness OR they cannot straddle the political divide.  Their default are the Democrats, even as they destroy themselves.  Even as their own members make antisemetic comments, which has happened in the Women's March, from Ilhan Omar and most recently, Mayor DeBlasio.  Coming from a Republican?  That ends a career.  Coming from these people, the most charitable explanation is always given.

I'm not saying there is no racism in America, but what I am saying is what you hear in our media is wildly out of proportion to what actually happens.  Racial events are big ratings for the media.  They have milked them and fanned the flames to keep them going.  They are doing that with the COVID-19 response right now.  When the positive cases finally plateaued and started going down, they immediately shifted to the death totals, because of the two week incubation period, they are still going up.  ""Death toll climbs!"" are the headlines, despite the fact hospitalization and new cases are going down, down, down."

&gt;An April study about the [effects of coronavirus media coverage](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/2020-44/)  analyzed two popular Fox News cable programs — and claims how one host  talked about the threat of the coronavirus resulted in greater numbers  of COVID-19 cases and deaths.

&gt;Researchers at the Becker Friedman  Institute for Economics at University of Chicago took a deep dive into  those implications in the working paper “Misinformation During a  Pandemic,” in which they examined the audience that watched *Hannity* versus *Tucker Carlson Tonight*.

&gt;Right-wing  Fox News is the most watched cable network in the U.S., and half of its  audience is over the age of 65. Many of its television shows and  personalities downplayed the threat of the novel coronavirus and thus [received harsh criticism](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/business/coronavirus-fox-news-lachlan-murdoch.html) for ignoring a public health crisis.

&gt;The  economists examined scripts from shows and studied how differential  exposure to the two shows affected behavior and health outcomes.  Conservative hosts Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson support President  Donald Trump, and they are at the helm of the two, most-widely viewed  cable news shows in the U.S. But they took different broadcasting paths  when the coronavirus first hit the U.S.

&gt;The paper notes that  Carlson was an outlier on Fox and, as early as Jan. 28, spent a chunk of  his show discussing the dangers of a global pandemic. He continued to  warn of deadly consequences.

&gt;On Feb. 25, according to the paper,  Carlson warned viewers of the potential impact the outbreak could have  in the U.S. “Currently, the coronavirus appears to kill about 2% of the  people who have it. So let's be generous for a moment and imagine that  asymptomatic carriers are not detected and the real death rate is only  say half a percent — that would be one quarter of the current estimates.  Even under that scenario, there would still be 27 million deaths from  coronavirus globally. In this country, more than a million would die,”  Carlson said.

&gt;Meanwhile, Hannity downplayed coronavirus as just  the flu and emphasized that Democrats were politicizing the virus to  undermine Trump.

&gt;“And today, thankfully, zero people in the United  States of America have died from the coronavirus. Zero. Now, let's put  this in perspective. In 2017, 61,000 people in this country died from  influenza, the flu. Common flu. Around 100 people die every single day  from car wrecks,” the paper quotes Hannity from his show on Feb. 27.

&gt;By  mid-March the host changed his posture and began to broadcast CDC  guidelines, according to the paper. “If you feel sick, stay at home. If  your kids feel sick, don't send them to school or day care. If someone  in your household has tested positive for coronavirus, please  self-quarantine your entire household. Keep them at home,” Hannity told  his viewers.

2069,2069,1588263101,"&gt;  you believe China had less that 5,000 deaths?

I expect China to *again* revise its numbers upward.

&gt; Knowing that Chinese cities have NYC sized in population Wuhan 8.3 million you believe those numbers? 

China did *extreme* shut-downs. People were forced simply to not go outside -- for any reason. Chinese social media is full of complaints about people having to train their pets to go on papers in their apartments because they couldn't take their dogs outside.

If people did venture outside, camera-equipped drones would hover about them. The drones' cameras were integrated into their facial recognition system and the drones would call out people *by name* and threaten them with fines or imprisonment.

People in the US are complaining about our stay-at-home restrictions of some states -- but we were nothing compared to what China did.

And from all reports, Chinese tactics were much more successful.

&gt; As for infected and dead, you cannot compare a country of 325 million to one of 60 - 70 million or less.

But don't forget: our gov't deliberately played politics and wasted weeks and weeks early in the pandemic.

It's pretty clear Trump's *strategy* was *not to test* as a way of keeping the numbers low. The administration has lied and lied again about the availability of testing -- it continues to this very day.

Thus, the number we're reporting are IMO just as much BS as China's probably are.

The NYC mayor has publicly stated a few days ago that 200-300 people *per day* were being picked up, people that died at home after being turned away sick from hospitals. Those dead people *are not being tested* and Trump has claimed that NY is falsely reporting virus deaths just to make him look bad. (!)

The CDC has reported the number of ""excess deaths"" in the US in the past couple of months is far higher than normal. Are those virus deaths that are untested? Likely, but since we don't have enough tests for the living/sick people -- again, IMO part of a strategy! -- testing the dead is a low priority.

&gt; So tell me again how horrible we are?

We're very horrible. This long-predicted pandemic shows how incompetent our gov't is -- how we let the virus kill blacks and the elderly and the poor. The famous FL rich community that has tests for every wealthy resident (and their servants!) or NBA teams testing athletes shows our inequality. It's sick.

Worse, the US using medical supplies as biological weapons to target countries we're attacking is inhuman. We've tightened sanctions on Iran, Venezuela and other countries we're targeting. Given our proven historical track record of using swine flu in Cuba it doesn't take much of a conspiracy theorist to wonder if we had a hand in using the virus in Iran.

But with our close allies like Germany and France complaining that we've illegally seized medical supplies bought and paid for by them, and with even Canada complaining about the US, our int'l track record during this pandemic is an embarrassment!

As the federal gov't pulls *trillions* out of thin air to pump into corporate America, Trump cutting off 1/2 *billion* from the WHO isn't MAGA, that's political suicide -- it's short-sighted stupidity that's beyond horrible.

&gt; “The 15 [cases in the US] within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero. We're going very substantially down, not up."" -- US president Donald Trump lying and downplaying the Covid-19 virus, 26 Feb. 2020."

* ""Residents"" refers to patients, not to staff. Try reading the thing you're linking to, idiot.
* The directive explicitly says that nursing homes must accept the return of patients who had been hospitalized, but are now ""medically stable"". The are not allowed to deny admission based on previous symptoms or even a previous diagnosis of COVID-19, but are allowed to deny admission if a patient is currently symptomatic.
* This directive was necessary because nursing homes were forcing residents to stay in hospitals even after the hospital had determined that the patient was not a threat, and this was overwhelming the hospitals and forcing them to turn away patients who do have COVID-19.
* u/BelizeBoy99 is an idiot and a liar."

She's spinning the mortality figures:

&gt;There are other countries that if you had a preexisting condition and let's say the virus caused you to go to the ICU and then have a heart or kidney problem some countries are recording as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a COVID-19 death. 

Really, Doctor? Which countries would those be, and what has been the impact on their COVID-19 mortality rates? What? Cat got your tongue?

She's also spinning the testing rates. She often gives numbers for testing capacity, rather than number of tests actually completed. She compares the number of tests done in the US to the number in South Korea, without regard to population differences. She never talks about the fact that some people are tested over an over, so ""30 tests per thousand people"" doesn't necessarily mean ""3% of the population has been tested"". Finally, when she does talk about tests per capita, she often compares the areas in the US where the most testing to the testing rates over entire countries.

It's time to recognize the fact that Birx is now more interested in maintaining her position than she is in candidly informing the public."
2072,2072,1588222183,"You're right -- int'l comparisons at this stage of the game are really iffy.

The CDC has noted that US ""excess deaths"" are significantly higher than normal over the last few months, likely due to untested COVID-19 deaths. We're likely to revise our death numbers much higher like China has done, and who knows if China is due for another revision.

With the US-China Cold War ramping up (not to mention campaign season!) this tragically will become an even larger political football."

2074,2074,1588201112,"“Professional opinion” is a stretch. Dr. Dan Erickson is wrong. Just because someone is wearing scrubs and sounds scientific doesn't mean they're correct. Just because he tests people doesn't mean anything, I test people too. He’s not board certified and is falsely representing his views as some sort of expert opinion when they’re not, and are false. 

He claimed his office's results showed that the virus had spread further in the area undetected, and thus wasn’t all that dangerous. That's misguided and statistically incorrect. They should never have assumed that the patients they tested (who came for walk-in COVID-19 tests or who went to urgent care for symptoms they experienced in the middle of a pandemic) are representative of the general population. For those not in medicine, that's like estimating the average height of Americans from the players on an NBA court. 

Then he makes a bad comparison to the flu. Flu mainly kills the very young and the old, about 30,000-40,000 Americans a year die of it. Covid-19 is much more contagious, we all have some immunity to flu but no immunity to this novel coronavirus, and as a result people of all ages are winding up in the ICU, and so far 60,000 Americans have died from the virus in 120 days. In just 4 months Covid has beaten the annual death toll of the flu, and we're not done since it's projected to possibly worsen in the fall. 

This guy in the video is claiming that disinfecting and staying home weakens your immune system? Baloney. There's a theory called the Hygiene Hypothesis where if children grow up in a sterile environment they may be more likely to develop allergies in their lifetime, but that's not what he's saying. A few weeks indoors will not do this, nor will it weaken your immune system. You're still inhaling 50+ species of germs with every breath you take, even with a mask on. 

""We didn't shut down for bird flu."" That's because bird flu was successfully contained with proper source control. If it got loose in NYC, then yes we would have shut the city down. I should know, I got to view the city's crisis plans in 2010.

So he's using bad data, and then making a flawed judgement on the basis of it. If we listen to his advice, the death toll WILL spike. He's clearly biased since he's making political ranting, and not using the actual data.

Both The American Academy of Emergency Medicine and the American College of Emergency Physicians [put out a joint statement](https://www.aaem.org/resources/statements/joint-endorsed/physician-misinformation) condemning his remarks.

2076,2076,1588188873,"Transcript of this column:

---

Almost a decade has passed since I published a column, “Myths of Austerity,” warning that deficit alarmism would delay recovery from the Great Recession — which it did. Unfortunately, that kind of alarmism seems to be making a comeback.

You can see that comeback in the gradually increasing number of news analyses emphasizing how much debt we’ll run up dealing with the Covid-19 crisis. You can also see it in the rhetoric of politicians like Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who is blocking aid to beleaguered state and local governments because, he says, it would cost too much.

So this seems like a good time to emphasize two key facts. One is economic: While we will run very big budget deficits over the next couple of years, they will do little if any harm. The other is that whatever they may say, very few prominent figures in politics or the media are genuine deficit hawks, who are actually worried about the consequences of rising government debt. What we mainly have, instead, are deficit peacocks and deficit vultures.

The term “deficit peacocks” was coined by the Center for American Progress for people who preen and posture about fighting deficits without offering realistic policy proposals. I’d broaden the term to include what I used to call Very Serious People — those who inveigh against the evils of debt not because they’ve done a careful analysis but because they imagine that it makes them sound earnest and tough-minded.

The glory days of deficit peacocks were the early teens, an era in which people like Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles were lionized by the news media. As Vox’s Ezra Klein noted at the time, for some reason “the usual rules of reportorial neutrality don’t apply when it comes to the deficit”; the wisdom and virtue of deficit warriors were simply taken for granted.

We haven’t heard much from the deficit peacocks in recent years, even though the budget deficit, which declined sharply during the Obama years, soared again under Donald Trump. Funny how that works. But you can be sure they’ll be back in force if Joe Biden wins this November.

What about deficit vultures? That’s the term I’ve been using for politicians who exploit real or imagined fiscal distress to feed a reactionary policy agenda.

After the last crisis, conservatives used deficits as an excuse to cut social programs — for example, a number of states made it much harder to collect unemployment benefits. This time around, McConnell and Trump are trying to exploit deficit fears to force state governments to downsize, undermine (and possibly privatize) the post office and more.

It goes almost without saying that the deficit vultures are hypocrites. After all, Trump and McConnell rammed through a $2 trillion tax cut in 2017, with no apparent concern about the effects on the deficit. Nor have I heard any Republican complaints about Trump’s huge bailouts for farmers, whose distress is largely the result of his own policies.

An aside: Far too much reporting on these issues involves what the economist Dean Baker calls mind-reading. That is, news analyses include statements along the lines of “Republicans are concerned about rising deficits,” when in fact all we know is that Republicans claim to be concerned about rising deficits — and there are very good reasons to be skeptical about that claim. After all, have modern Republicans ever seen deficits as a constraint on their own tax-cutting agenda? Even once?

Still, hypocrisy aside, should we be worried about the effects of Covid-19 on debt? No.

It’s true that we’re headed for some eye-popping numbers. Last week the Congressional Budget Office released preliminary economic and budget projections for the next two years, which were both shocking and unsurprising.

That is, the numbers were grim but more or less in line with what many independent economists have been predicting. In particular, the budget office expects the Covid-19 crisis to drive the unemployment rate to 16 percent in a few months, which might even be on the low side.

Soaring unemployment will cause federal revenues to plunge, and also lead to a surge in spending on safety-net programs like unemployment insurance, Medicaid and food stamps. Add in the large relief packages Congress has passed, and the budget office projects a deficit that will temporarily rise to levels we haven’t seen since World War II, and it expects federal debt to rise to 108 percent from 79 percent of G.D.P., which sounds scary.

But the government will be able to borrow that money at incredibly low interest rates. In fact, real interest rates — rates on government bonds protected against inflation — are negative. So the burden of the additional debt as measured by the rise in federal interest payments will be negligible. And no, we don’t have to worry about paying off the debt; we never will, and that’s OK.

The bottom line is that right now, the only thing we have to fear from deficits is deficit fear itself. Pay no attention to the peacocks and vultures: In this time of pandemic, we can and should spend whatever it takes to limit the damage."
2077,2077,1588187427,"&gt; In a typical year, there are between 37,000 and 60,000 deaths from the flu.

The deaths from COVID-19 already surpass most years for the flu, and we are 3 months into this. If we are at peak deaths and we have no further outbreaks, then we will end the year with about 120k deaths.

[The flu is the 8th most common cause of death in the US.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm) If COVID-19 remains on track for the year, then it will probably beat out diabetes and Alzheimer's for the year.

With a little bad luck, COVID-19 will surpass 150k deaths and slide past strokes and smoking (chronic lower respiratory diseases) to take #3 spot for the cause of death this year.

So... yeah, stop posting nonsense about how this is 'just the flu'. Its a rapidly spreading disease for which we have no treatment or vaccine. This makes it worse than the flu."

&gt;As of this date, the total number of reported patients treated with  HCQ, with or without azithromycin and zinc, is 2,333. Of these, 2,137 or  91.6 percent improved clinically. There were 63 deaths, all but 11 in a  single retrospective report from the Veterans Administration where the  patients were severely ill.  
 

This sentence does not mean HCQ has a 90% chance of helping covid  patients.   It means that 90% of covid improved clinically with HCQ.  It  is unknown how many would improve without HCQ

  

&gt;At this time, the data from 9 observational reports and one  controlled trial suggest that hydroxychloroquine is dramatically more  effective at preventing death from CoVID-19 than mechanical ventilation.  It is encouraging to note that ventilated patients treated with  hydroxychloroquine have been able to undergo successful extubation and  transfer out of the intensive care unit onto the floor. Moreover,  CoVID-19 viral loads have been reduced to low or undetectable levels  after 5-15 days of treatment with hydroxychloroquine."
2081,2081,1588109969,"The general recovery rate of COVID-19 is 96% for confirmed cases. So... a clinical improvement rate of 90% isn't that great.

They should have reported the death rate with and without treatment instead. With treatment, the recovery rate is 97%. Without treatment, the recovery rate is 96%.

So hydroxychloroqiune might make a 1% difference."
2082,2082,1588105224,"""And just who do you think would declare the emergency? Oh, right, the State, because private actors would be able to abuse it if they were the lone authority for this...""

Not exactly sure why you're arguing this point or why it even matters to you in this context, but if you have a landlord, you don't own where you live and there are a variety of ways you can get kicked out.

""...Europe is getting more than double the number of immigrants than the USA. So, which is the more attractive, then?""

​And how's that working out?  BTW, you're physically closer to the war torn areas courtesy of the Western powers.  Thankfully, Trump doesn't seem interested in ginning up further conflict.

But in the US, our immigrants tend to integrate because we are a large country with vast lands.  Unfortunately for Europe, not the case and you have pockets of problems because when immigrants don't integrate, you're going to have problems.  No one but lunatics are AGAINST immigration, you just have too much.  But hey, it's your country.  If you think you can screen tens of thousands of people for COVID effectively, support them with taxpayer money and give them free healthcare, go for it.  We've done the math in the U.S.  Newsflash, you can't and neither can we.  And we have way more money.

""I am pretty sure you will balk at giving the State that much control (with, I would agree, some good reasons).""

""By the way, corporatists have been at the helm for decades in the USA, given the current shitshow, would you consider ousting them?""

It's not the way it works here.  Yeah, we got our share of corporatists, but it's a battle between them, the old rich, the new rich, the famous and on and on.  There's a lot of people in the mix.  No one group or person can be in charge.  That's why there's a bit of chaos, because there needs to be.  Centralize things too much and you get the EU.

""For once, governments are doing what they were built for: supporting citizens.""

Hahahahaha!  Wow.  Have you EVER read a history book?

""Cool. As I have said, why don't you volunteer in a local hospital without protective gear?""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No.  Sorry, guy-who-doesn't-live-here.  It's weird how immigrants keep want to come here to such a ""busted"" country.  So weird.

Numbers have been going down since 2016. Now, this is also an effect of Trump's policies, I will give you that. By the way, Europe is getting more than double the number of immigrants than the USA. So, which is the more attractive, then?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I can find links too. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/gabrielleigh/2020/04/27/the-predicted-coronavirus-catastrophe-hasnt-arrived-in-sweden-whats-next/#141618e53caf](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gabrielleigh/2020/04/27/the-predicted-coronavirus-catastrophe-hasnt-arrived-in-sweden-whats-next/#141618e53caf)

Which is an entirely anecdotal testimony. I provided numbers, you provide somebody's diary. I wonder which is more significant...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That keeping people in their homes is pointless when millions are  already infected.  The only people that NEED to stay home are the  elderly and those with underlying medical conditions.  The rest can  mitigate.

So, how many people do you think that makes? Heart disease, overweight, respiratory disease, cancer... That makes for a significant chunk of the population. You say millions have been infected. Germany has been widely testing, as well as South Korea. Germany has an 80 million population, South Korea has about 50 millions inhabitants. They both report way less than millions of cases (Korea is at[less than 11 000](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/), Germany at [less than 160 000](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/germany/) to this date).

So, nope, there were not millions of cases or positive people. If you were to extrapolate the number, by taking Germany, for example and multiplying the cases to account for the difference in population, you would get between 600 000 and 750 000 cases in the USA. The USA have blown past that.

South Korea has proactively traced people and isolated the contaminated cases. Germany has strictly controlled gatherings and contacts, while some Länder have locked down. Unless you are prepared to accept these measures, lockdowns are still the best bet to limit overburdening health systems. Then again, I am pretty sure you will balk at giving the State that much control (with, I would agree, some good reasons).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If you knew anything about government, you'd know that they are an illusion anyway.

I have worked for a government, and now work for an international institution. I would say I have a pretty good picture of the differences between countries with and with social safety nets.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Fuck the WHO.  Let it close.  Someone will be build a new one and if the  WHO closes, the employees at the new organization will remember what  happened.

I would rather reform it and actually make it independent.

By the way, corporatists have been at the helm for decades in the USA, given the current shitshow, would you consider ousting them? Just following your line of thought, here...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You just agreed that people were too gullible in trusting the WHO.

No, I said that the WHO was too gullible for trusting the Chinese authorities, who provided it with faulty data.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Maybe Google the Great Depression and do some math.

The Great Depression was not caused by a pandemic. The deaths and ruined lives were caused by the economic damage. Here, the deaths are caused by a disease, and thedeaths will cause economic damage in turn.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's going to be a lot worse if you've lost your house, your job and your life is falling apart.

Woulda been nice to have a government actually supporting its citizens, right... Japan has now announced that it will take over paying the salaries of furloughed employees, France is paying furloughed employees two thirds of their salaries, and more and more countries are doing the same. For once, governments are doing what they were built for: supporting citizens.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Reopening is risk, but so is life.  We're now at the point where this is an acceptable risk.

Cool. As I have said, why don't you volunteer in a local hospital without protective gear? Hey, it's a risk, but so is life, right? It is easy to sacrifice somebody else's life. How about you only gamble yours away?

Oh, by the way, the[young and healthy who get contaminated](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/22/health/strokes-coronavirus-young-adults/index.html)? [They may suffer strokes](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-stroke-deaths-symptoms-covid-19-heart-a9484091.html), which either kills them or leaves them unable to work and function as well as before. Which puts another drain on public resources, unless you advocate leaving to rot after they suffer the stroke. Then again, I suppose libertarians would be fine with that, small government and all that, right?"

Is it really to this point that we're going to have to have states deploy the national guard to protect their shipments and supplies and treat the federal government like the enemy?

This is no different from the Somalian government stealing food sent by the United Nations and cartels selling it illegally. [(11)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/10/aid-somalia-stolen-un-report)

Except in this situation FEMA is the cartels and the banana republic is the United States.

Also regarding Trump removing the watchdog overseeing the $2 trillion coronavirus bill? In 1998 the Supreme Court ruled line item vetos are unconstitutional. [(12)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_v._City_of_New_York)

His excuse? The Take Care Clause. And the Take Care Clause just says the President can't make his underlings do stuff that's against the law. It underscores that the executive is under a duty to faithfully execute the laws of Congress and not disregard them. [(13)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution)

If you don't know what that's about, Trump wrote a signing statement (basically functionally a line item veto except the next President could undo it, but by then it'd be too late) into the stimulus bill that he was going to ignore the oversight provisions in the bill and do it himself. [(14)](https://www.motherjones.com/coronavirus-updates/2020/03/trump-says-hell-ignore-key-oversight-provision-in-stimulus-bill-1/) Either way, the Take Care Clause makes it illegal. 

According to Bradley and Posner, since the president is actually obligated under the “Take Care Clause” to comply with the constitution, “if the president believes that a statute violates the constitution, he has a constitutional obligation not to enforce it” (Bradley and Posner: 358).[(16)](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1411&amp;context=etd) The opposite also holds true (see citation 13)."

2088,2088,1587946394,"The 18 million figure was ***worldwide*** and ***in total*** for the multiple-year period in which it persisted. We're maybe 6 months in and there are already over 200K deaths worldwide.

Given the improvements in medicine and hygiene over the last century, per capita figures should be lower for COVID-19, but it's already significantly more deadly than typical influenza.

Without much more testing than the US is apparently capable of performing, it'll remain impossible to know the base of those infected or having gotten through mild cases. OTOH, we do have fairly good figures for COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, and the ratio of deaths to hospitalizations is worst than influenza."

However, few politician or back-to-work supporter has been clear that they'd accept deaths within their own families in order to save the economy.

Also, unless you'd only apply strict social distancing to prohibiting funeral services and wakes, every person who dies is a loss of future work days for that person as well as (usually) 5 work days for close family, and a half workday for those who attend memorial services. Lots more deaths will mean lots of lost worktime, so reduced productivity (and morale).

If schools, day care, YMCAs/YWCAs, summer camps, etc remain closed, at least one parent in 2-earner families ain't going back to the office, store, factory, dispatch center, etc.

The big questions are whether contracting COVID-19 at work would expose employers to workers comp claims or (much worse) liability tort suits. If so, employers would have a significant DISINCENTIVE to reopen quickly."

2094,2094,1587889690,"&gt; There was a pandemic in 1793 Philadelphia, while it was the capital of the nation for a decade. This was two years after the Bill of Rights made it into law, with the right to assemble and right against self incrimination and right to due process. 28,000 people lived in Philadelphia. 5,000 died. At least 12,000 were displaced from their homes. 

&gt; That means over 50% of the nation's capital was either killed or displaced by a pandemic two years after the Bill of Rights was ratified, and they both maintained the capital there for a further seven years, and did not add an illness exception for States to override the Bill of Rights.

That's a great anecdote and all but we now have a better understanding of disease and how they're spread than. What's more is you're comparing the yellow fever to COVID-19, virus that are vastly different in vector, incubation period, duration of the disease, and symptoms (COVID-19 symptoms can be asymptomatic). Did you also notice that 20,000 fled the city? You think that's a realistic solution right now? Yeah, me neither.

&gt; The Federal government is completely allowed to do what States are doing, but it is irresponsible for anyone to permit a State governor to exercise Federal powers, which is what abridging assembly, travel, or due process is. That is a Federal power exclusively. 

The federal government has not responded effectively to this crisis and it was up to the States to manage the response. Your originalist interpretation of the Constitution means nothing when you've elected a demagogue to the office of President who cares more about enriching himself than the wellbeing of the people he's serving.

&gt; This is important in times of crisis, because if all they have to do to get you to ignore the Constitution is release an illness, get ready for the next one to be intentional, or for the next step to be expanding this beyond pandemics.

That's why it's important to trust the consensus of public health experts and medical professionals rather than figureheads and politicians. If those people are intelligent and good leaders, they'll listen to and emulate the information from those communities rather than pontificating conjecture. 

Your example of ""the government"" taking control of people's lives is the same cynically-driven straw man we've seen thrown out here since this all started in the U.S.

&gt; This is a very short sighted precedent to set. The Governors do not have or need this power.

Clearly when there is a lack of leadership at the federal level during a national crisis it is warranted.

&gt; We have FEMA. They have the power and experts and capability already, Governors need to stay in their jurisdiction.

Fuck FEMA bud. They've been seizing supplies intended for States for weeks now.

2095,2095,1587871422,"&gt; Scott W. Atlas, MD, is the David and Joan Traitel Senior Fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution and the former chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center.

First things first: neither the general coursework for an MD nor the additional study needed for certification in neuroradiology is a substitute for actual study in epidemiology. This person may have more peripheral knowledge and understanding of the details of epidemiology than most laymen, but he likely knows as much about epidemiology as he knows about reconstructive orthopedic surgery.

&gt; Fact 1: The overwhelming majority of people do not have any significant risk of dying from COVID-19.

Given the 0.1-0.2% fatality range he mentions, that's a mere 330K-660K people. Certainly no concern for anyone.

And the young and those without preexisting conditions have little to worry about. As for the old and those with preexisting conditions, well, they should get on with decreasing the surplus population to make life easier for the rest of us. Sheesh, what selfishness trying to cling to life!

&gt; Fact 2: Protecting older, at-risk people eliminates hospital overcrowding.

Mostly true, but what about younger people with serious preexisting conditions? Also, given that Coronavirus is ALREADY in lots of nursing homes AND prisons, what scope is there left for reducing hospitalizations in the next few months?

&gt; Fact 3: Vital population immunity is prevented by total isolation policies, prolonging the problem.

True, but the question is whether it's better to slow down the spread of infection or accelerate it. No one questions whether everyone will eventually be exposed to the virus. However, the goal is for serious cases NOT to exceed available medical resources such as ventilators.

Gotta wonder whether this MD believes the number of healthcare workers who've died from COVID-19 is a measure of the wisdom of slowing exposure unless all of them were old and/or had preexisting conditions. In which case had sensible isolation policies required them NOT to work with COVID-19 cases, who would have replaced them?

&gt; Fact 4: People are dying because other medical care is not getting done due to hypothetical projections.

&gt; Critical health care for millions of Americans is being ignored and people are dying to accommodate “potential” COVID-19 patients . . . [t]hat prevented diagnoses of life-threatening diseases, . . .

Fair point. Coronavirus should not prevent all other medical treatment.

However, have all medical practices closed down? Have all lab facilities which [used to] process biopsies been converted to processing Coronavirus tests? Have emergency appendectomies ceased? People suffering heart attacks or broken hips from falling been left in their homes to make do?

&gt; Fact 5: We have a clearly defined population at risk who can be protected with targeted measures.

Have most of the healthcare workers who've died from COVID-19 been older and/or suffered from preexisting conditions?

&gt; it is a commonsense, achievable goal to target isolation policy to that group,

Also providing financial support to that group?

&gt; Nursing home residents, the highest risk, should be the most straightforward to systematically protect from infected people, . . .

Agreed, but how does one protect them once Coronavirus has entered a nursing home and been contracted by, say, 10% or more patients?

Would there be government financial support for low-paid nursing home staff who commonly need to work at multiple sites?

&gt; . . . and open most workplaces and small businesses with some prudent large-group precautions.

Such as? I can think of 2 2nd hand book stores within 3 miles of my house which have narrow passages within their stores. 6 feet of separation would be challenging.

Hard to see how airline, train or bus travel would be appealing to anyone other than those who have contracted COVID-19 and survived. OTOH, good luck with cruise ships, sports arenas, theaters, bars, etc."

Give me a break. The US has literally *centuries* of history interfering in Latin America! To claim we're not neck deep involved in Venezuela's internal affairs is absurd.

We've *designed* Venezuela's entire economy to be dependent on the US -- that's one of the reasons they're so susceptible to our sanctions. The US hates the socialist party there for interfering with our vassal. The Kochs were forced to push for the Keystone XL pipeline when Venezuela cut its heavy oil to Koch's Gulf Coast refineries. Guaido is just the latest puppet we've bankrolled and unilaterally anointed as president. We've done similar things again and again.

We hold no moral high ground. 

We're the laughingstock of the world -- it's just that other countries don't say the truth publicly because it'd be rude and we'd attack them. Because as survey after survey reveals, the people of planet earth view the US as the biggest threat to world peace.

Hyperinflation has made Venezuela's currency [worthless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Venezuela). 

As a result of the election fraud, the Venezuelan Supreme Court invalidated the last election and declared that  Juan Guaidó, the elected President of the National Assembly in Venezuela, should lead an interim government so that a new, non-fraudulent election could be held. This is the resolution that conforms to Venezuela's constitution, and which is backed by the Organization of American States and virtually every democratic nation on earth. Backing Maduro are Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Iran, Syria, China, and of course, Russia.

This was all resolved in undemocratic fashion about a year ago, when Maduro used the Army to suppress popular demonstrations against his rule. So pretty much the opposite of a coup d'etat. Now elected leaders like Guaido and Supreme Court justices are living in exile, and the people of Venezuela are still starving and are at extreme risk for a covid-19 outbreak, due to a breakdown in public services resulting from Maduro's incompetence and corruption.

This is an old story, there was no coup, the dictator won, and the US did not interfere in any way. The story is being resurrected now by Russian propagandists who hope to convince people that Biden would be just as bad as Trump, so they may as well stay home or vote for Trump or a 3rd party."

2110,2110,1587567617,"Here's what pisses me off about the stimulus checks.  
  
The theory behind a stimulus check is sound, essentially you inject a bunch of cash into peoples pockets and then they go out and spend it.  At each point where the money changes hands, some of it gets taxed back to the government, and when changing hands creates economic multipliers.  
  
When you do just that, it's essentially free and can be a good tool to mitigate a slow quarter or two for business.  It's a tool to help a slowing economy, by giving people EXTRA money.  But that's not how it's being used now due to mass layoffs from COVID and other factors.  
  
That $1200 is instead being used as a replacement for wages.  For those working who took pay cuts, it's the government subsidizing private companies wages, and for those not working, it's replacing a single paycheck to ensure more people can make their rent payment.  
  
It is not being spent as economic stimulus, and that means the money isn't changing hands a lot.  It's not extra money, it's replacing what people had (and not even replacing that).  Meaning it's expensive, and not going to head off any sort of recession.  
  
Furthermore, it was funded essentially as an advance on our taxes for next year.  It's not designed to have it's costs recouped through creating additional spending, but rather through being collected again in income tax on regular spending.  
  
The whole thing is a farce, and if all of that weren't bad enough, it's $6000 per person, with the individual seeing $1200 of that and the remaining $4800 going directly to the wealthy which is the exact opposite of how successful economic stimulus works."

It's clear that outlets for Russian disinformation like zerohedge are [actively trying to harm the US by spreading disinformation](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-response-covid-19) about the virus. The question is, why are people like u/BoondockSaint45 helping them?"

Does the common flu cause our impeached president to seize supplies bought and paid for by other US-allied countries (e.g. France, Germany, Canada) and thus cause the US to be even more hated internationally?

The entire for-profit US health care system **broke** when we needed it the most!

Which does little or nothing for an unemployed person who cannot afford the co-payments and deductibles of sh\*tty for-profit US health insurance.

&gt;  Every Democratic nominee for president for the past 30 years has pushed for universal healthcare.

I call BS. Obama sold out without even trying. Before him Bill Clinton put Hillary in charge who tried to cooperate with the insurance corporations. After Hillary failed the Democrats removed nat'l health care from their platform.

Despite solid majorities of Americans wanting Medicare-for-All or nat'l health care, our 2 corporate-controlled ruling parties refuse to act on it. The rich people and corporations who bankroll our 2 ruling parties don't want it, so the 2 parties refuse to act."

**ABC published a correction the following day:**

This is not true. It is another Trump conspiracy theory.

2136,2136,1587067530,"&gt;are sick with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus

I find this an interesting use of wording...

What is a coronavirus?

&gt;coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. A newly identified type has caused a recent outbreak of  a **respiratory illness** now called COVID-19. -CDC

So what does ""COVID-19"" stand for?

&gt;In COVID-19, 'CO' stands for 'corona,' 'VI' for 'virus,' and 'D' for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”. There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. -CDC

Those two terms are redundant in defining each other, but do not inform as to what the disease is from these terms. We do know that a respiratory illness is involved, but the term does not inform or define as to *what* respiratory illness is involved.

What is the name of the disease caused by the coronavirus?

&gt;The virus has been named “SARS-CoV-2” and the disease it causes has been named “coronavirus disease 2019” (abbreviated “COVID-19”). -CDC

Wait... SARS means Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory illness **caused** by a coronavirus called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003. The illness spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia before the SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained.

&gt;Since 2004, there have not been any known cases of SARS reported anywhere in the world. The content in this website was developed for the 2003 SARS epidemic. But some guidelines are still being used. Any new SARS updates will be posted on this website. -CDC


Okay, so what I'm seeing here, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that COVID-19 is the carrier that creates SARS in some(many) of the infected. I'm no scientist or doctor, but it would appear to me that the label ""SARS-CoV-2"" means 'the second coming of Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)'.

&gt;The target organ of *severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)* is widely believed to be the lungs, hence the names “severe acute respiratory syndrome” and “SARS atypical pneumonia” (1, 2). However, patients often have evidence of other organ dysfunction, including gastrointestinal symptoms (3), abnormal liver function (4, 5), splenic atrophy, and lymphadenopathy (6). This may reflect widespread immunopathology or the presence of extrapulmonary SARS-coronavirus (CoV) dissemination and replication, as has been observed in other species infected with animal coronavirus (7). Recent reports of multiple organ infection by the virus were based mostly on partial autopsies (8). A comprehensive theory of pathogenesis for this newly emerged infectious disease is lacking. -ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2213088/

Can infect organs, fill lungs up with fluid, rapidly. And, is highly virulent. Okay, I see the scientific worry.

What does this mean for you though?

&gt;Genotype and phenotype of COVID-19: Their roles in pathogenesis

&gt;At present, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19. Given the high rate of transmission of this virus between humans and its pandemics, it is important to identify the basis of its replication, structure, and pathogenicity for discovering a way to the special treatment or the prevention. Due to the high similarity of the virus to its families, efforts have been made to provide medicines and vaccines for COVID-19. Differences in the length of the spike as it is longer in COVID-19 are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of this virus. However, identifying the specific molecular details of the virus is helpful in achieving treatment goals. -sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118220300827 [31 March, 2020]

&gt;The call for body bags came late Saturday.

&gt;By Monday, the police in a small New Jersey town had gotten an anonymous tip about a body being stored in a shed outside one of the state’s largest nursing homes.

&gt;When the police arrived, the corpse had been removed from the shed, but they discovered 17 bodies piled inside the nursing home in a small morgue intended to hold no more than four people.

&gt;“They were just overwhelmed by the amount of people who were expiring,” said Eric C. Danielson, the police chief in Andover, a small township in Sussex County, the state’s northernmost county.

&gt;The 17 were among 68 recent deaths linked to the long-term care facility, Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center I and II, including two nurses, officials said. Of those who died, 26 people had tested positive for the virus.

&gt;For the others, the cause of death is unknown.

&gt;Of the patients who remain at the homes, housed in two buildings, 76 have tested positive for the virus; 41 staff members, including an administrator, are sick with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, according to county health records shared on Wednesday with a federal official.

&gt;Andover Subacute is not alone. The coronavirus has swept through the New York region’s nursing homes with devastating and deadly speed, killing thousands of residents at facilities struggling with staff shortages, increasingly sick patients and a lack of personal protective gear.

&gt;But with beds for 700 patients, Andover Subacute is, records show, the state’s largest licensed facility — and the risk of continued spread is terrifying to family members who have turned to social media and their local congressman, desperate for answers and extra personnel.

&gt;“The challenge we’re having with all of these nursing homes, is once it spreads, it’s like a wildfire,” said Representative Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat who got the call on Saturday, asking for body bags. “It’s very hard to stop it.”

&gt;One of the owners of the facility, Chaim Scheinbaum, did not return calls or emails. Staff members who answered phones at the facilities said they were not authorized to speak to the news media.

&gt;Even before the pandemic, the nursing home had struggled. Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation II recently got a one-star rating of “much below average” from Medicare for staffing levels, inspections and patient care.

&gt;“I feel so helpless,” one woman, who started a group for family members, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. “I feel like everyone is going to get Covid. What do we do?”

&gt;Staff members at the facility were asking the same thing.

&gt;“To all the people calling into the governor’s office, the congressman’s office to help us tell them WE NEED HELP,” a representative of Andover Subacute &amp; Rehab Center Two wrote at 7:18 p.m. on Monday, in a Facebook post that was deleted on Wednesday.

&gt;After news began to be shared on Wednesday about the bodies found in the makeshift morgue, a discovery first reported by The New Jersey Herald, the fear intensified.

&gt;Mr. Gottheimer said his office had fielded calls from staff members and worried relatives pleading for help. He said he had spoken to a representative of the Federal Emergency Management Agency about the possibility of sending National Guard medics.

&gt;The state Department of Health sent two shipments containing 3,200 surgical masks, 1,400 N95 masks and 10,000 gloves to the nursing homes, said Donna Leusner, a spokeswoman. The first shipment went out about a week ago and the second should have been delivered Tuesday or Wednesday, she said.

&gt;“It’s scary for everybody — for the residents and for the staff,” Mr. Gottheimer said. “What is surprising to me is how many are dying in house, versus the hospital.”

&gt;The nursing home has told local health officials that they are housing sick patients on separate wings or floors, Chief Danielson said. And local residents have been gathering supplies to donate to the nursing home.

&gt;Several women created a Facebook page and a website, Sparta Helps Healthcare Heroes, to gather needed gowns, gloves and masks.

&gt;“At first, it was kind of like, ‘What can we do?’” said one of the organizers, LeeAnne Pitzer. “Now we have an army of sewers who are making handmade masks that can be washed and reused.”

&gt;One resident of Sparta, Cheryl Boggs, said she found three boxes of Tyvek suits and bootees in a storage room at the company where she works, Petro-Mechanics. She dropped them off on Monday after seeing the pleas for help on Facebook.

&gt;“We just wanted to help,” she said.

&gt;Lily Repasch, 84, died three weeks ago at Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center I.

&gt;Her son and three daughters were regular visitors to the facility, even talking through a window in her final days after the state ordered all long-term care facilities to stop allowing visitors.

&gt;The women said the facility offered no way for them to communicate with their mother, who had dementia, and provided family members no information. Their mother was never tested for the coronavirus.

&gt;“Her death was inevitable,” said one daughter, Lee Repasch. “But she was a vulnerable woman with dementia. It was inevitable, but it didn’t need to be like this.”

&gt;Most of the state’s nursing homes have reported at least one case of the coronavirus, which as of Wednesday had infected 6,815 patients of long-term care facilities in New Jersey. At least 45 of the 351 coronavirus-related deaths announced on Wednesday were residents of long-term care facilities.

&gt;Gov. Philip D. Murphy said that once the threat of the pandemic passes, New Jersey must take a hard look at what went wrong.

&gt;“It’s pretty clear that a big weakness in the system, and in reality, is long-term care facilities,” he said.

&gt;Thirteen of the bodies discovered on Monday at the Andover facility were moved to a refrigerated truck outside a hospital in nearby Newton, Chief Danielson said. A funeral home had made arrangements to pick up the other four.

&gt;He said he was not entirely surprised by the number of bodies discovered.

&gt;“I don’t know if I’m shocked by any means,” he said."
2139,2139,1587042920,"&gt;Three days later, all Icelandic residents that entered the country were required to go into 14 days of quarantine, regardless of where they were traveling from.

&gt;It wasn't until after all this action that, on March 24, Iceland's first death was reported. That same day, authorities banned gatherings of above 20 people and shut down public amenities, such as bars, swimming pools, museums and gyms.

&gt;Lesson #8: Use tech, but respect privacy

&gt;Like in Taiwan, Icelandic officials also made an app available for people to download to help chart the virus' spread. It creates a log of where the user has been. Users don't have to share that data with authorities -- but many do as it helps contact-tracing teams work out who may have been put at risk.

&gt;In comparison, the UK's response has been slow. A government-supported app is only now in the works and is weeks away from launching. As it lags behind in testing, it is only just now looking into public-private partnerships.

&gt;South Korea

&gt;It's telling that South Korea reported its first coronavirus case at around the same time as the US and UK. South Korea is confirming around 30 new cases a day, while in the UK it's around 5,000, and the US it's more than 20,000.

&gt;The way each country tests varies, but their death rates among the population contrast just as dramatically. Fewer than one in every 100,000 people in South Korea's population have died from the virus, while in the UK it's around 18. It's almost eight in every 100,000 in the US, JHU data shows.

&gt;Lesson #9: You can drive-through test

&gt;South Korea's success has been largely down to its testing, according to Dr. Eom Joong Sik from the Gil Medical Center near Seoul. Eom is treating coronavirus patients in hospital and sits on a committee that advises the government in its response.

&gt;""Early diagnosis, early quarantine and early treatment are key,"" he told CNN.

&gt;""Since the first patient was confirmed, by installing more than 500 screening clinics all over the country, we sorted suspected cases and conducted tests, and we have worked hard to develop and maintain a system to conduct many tests with a small workforce over a short period of time,"" he said.

&gt;The country has also been innovative in how it tests. Eom's advisory team had hundreds of drive-through booths, just like at a McDonald's, set up across the country to offer tests that were largely free, quick and done by staff at a safe distance. The US has since replicated that model in some states.

&gt;On March 16, the WHO called on governments of the world to ""test, test, test."" South Korea had already been doing that for weeks, and has to date tested more than 500,000 people, among the highest number in the world per capita.

&gt;Many countries are struggling to carry out thousands of tests each day. It's so difficult to get tested in the UK, for example, that people have been turning to mail-order kits, in an industry that hasn't yet been regulated by the government.

&gt;South Korea was also quick to move, implementing quarantining and screening measures for people arriving from Wuhan on January 3, more than two weeks before the country's first infection was even confirmed. Authorities rolled out a series of travel restrictions over the weeks after.

&gt;South Korea has also been rigorous in its contact tracing, though it was able to do that easily when it realized a large number of cases could be traced to one religious group in the city of Daegu, making contact tracing easier and giving authorities a specific area to carry out intensive testing.

&gt;""By carrying out tests on all members of the congregation and diagnosing even infected people without symptoms, the government carried out quarantine and treatment side by side,"" Eom said.

&gt;Once Daegu was established as the epicenter, authorities were ready with the ability and political will to test broadly, to trace contacts of people infected, and to quarantine them to try and contain the virus before it became a case of mitigating widescale death, as is now the case in much of Europe and the US.

&gt;Lesson #10: Learn from the past

&gt;South Korea was able to move quickly because, like Taiwan and many other Asian nations, it had been burned before. South Korea was mostly unaffected by the SARS outbreak, only reporting three cases and no deaths at all. But it was caught off guard by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2015, when it recorded 186 cases and 38 deaths, making it the worst-impacted country outside the Middle East.

&gt;So the political will needed to enforce measures during the coronavirus outbreak wasn't a problem and there was good coordination between the central government and the provinces.

&gt;It also helped that South Korea is one of the most technologically innovative countries in the world. Much of life there is already conducted online, so developing and enforcing the use of an app to monitor people in quarantine wasn't too difficult, though activists there too have warned of invasion of privacy.

&gt;Germany

&gt;Germany's case is a little different. The country hasn't really been able to keep infection numbers at bay much better than some of the hardest-hit nations. It currently has more than 132,000 confirmed infections, the fifth-highest in the world, JHU reports.

&gt;But Germany has been able to keep the death rate in its population relatively low. More than 3,400 people have died from the virus in Germany, around four people in every 100,000 across the country. That's well below Italy's 35 and the UK's 18.

&gt;Lesson #11: Test more as restrictions ease

&gt;Germany's success has also been its mass testing, but its well-resourced universal healthcare system has played a major role too, according to Martin Stürmer, a virologist who heads IMD Labor in Frankfurt, one of the labs conducting tests. Germany has also drawn in the private sector to make sure enough tests are carried out.

&gt;""From the beginning, Germany didn't stick to one or two or three central labs doing all the tests. Many private companies were involved, so we've been able to do 100,000 tests a day,"" Stürmer told CNN.

&gt;""There are some countries that have done it even better than Germany, in controlling infections, but what's quite important is broad testing, where we were able to see what was happening in our population. Only with mass testing can you identify people who might be infected.""

&gt;Like Taiwan, South Korea and Iceland, Germany devised a test for the coronavirus and prepared a large number of kits early, well before the country even reported its first death.

&gt;As German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced Wednesday that the country would begin gradually scaling back its lockdown, the country is planning on carrying out even more tests, in case the increased contact leads to a second wave of infections. Like many countries, it will also test for antibodies to try and determine who among the community may be immune to the virus.

&gt;Germany's death toll has remained relatively low in part because the coronavirus trickled into the country mostly in young people. Many had been visiting Italy or Austria on ski trips.

&gt;Authorities were able to test people returning to Germany from these ski resorts and trace their contacts for testing too. Most of those people were young, and still today, the biggest age group by infections is 35-59, followed by 15-34. The virus is proving to be deadlier among the elderly around the world.

&gt;But as communal infections in the country grow, Stürmer fears that more elderly people could die in coming weeks and that the country's death rate will go up.

&gt;Germany recorded 315 deaths from complications related to Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, the country's center for disease control, the Robert Koch Institute, wrote on its website on Thursday. This is the first time more than 300 deaths have been reported in a 24-hour span.

&gt;Lesson #12: Build capacity at hospitals

&gt;Germany ranks 18th in the world in terms of access to quality healthcare, according to an index published by The Lancet, sitting above the UK at 23rd and the US at 29th. But these indices only tell us so much. Italy, for example, ranks ninth and the country also carried out rigorous testing, yet it has recorded the second-highest number of deaths per capita in the world, after Spain.

&gt;In this situation, the difference appears to be the German healthcare system's huge capacity. Germany is projected to need about 12,000 beds at the peak of this outbreak in the middle of the month, according to projections from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. It has over 147,000, more than 10 times its need.

&gt;In contrast, the US has around 94,000 beds, some 15,000 beds short of its need. Germany has more spare beds in intensive care units that Italy has altogether.

&gt;In fact, Germany's health system has such a large capacity, its hospitals are now treating people for coronavirus from Italy, Spain and France.

&gt;Authorities have been able to get people with even moderate symptoms to hospital well before their conditions deteriorate, leading some experts to consider whether treating people early, getting them on ventilators before their condition worsens, for example, improves their chances for survival."

&gt;In our globalized world, it's puzzling that so few lessons were learned in the early weeks of each country's outbreak, when the chances of containing and stopping the virus were highest. Now the focus is on flattening the curve, or slowing the virus' spread, to keep death tolls from climbing further.

&gt;As much of the world mulls gradually lifting lockdowns, there are still lessons to be learned from these four places that got it right. Here are 12 of those lessons.

&gt;Taiwan

&gt;Sitting just 180 kilometers (110 miles) off the coast of mainland China, Taiwan's outbreak could have been disastrous. At the end of January, the island was estimated to have had the second-highest number of cases in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University (JHU).

&gt;But Taiwan, with a population of around 24 million people, has recorded just over 390 cases and six deaths, and yesterday, it reported no new cases at all. It's managed to do that without implementing severe restrictions, like lockdowns, or school and nursery closures.

&gt;In terms of its death toll, at least, Taiwan doesn't even have much of a curve to flatten, more of a line with a couple of rigid steps.

&gt;Compare that to the United States -- now the world's hardest-hit nation, at least in raw numbers -- which has reported at least 26,000 deaths. Even when you take population size into account, a level of success like Taiwan's could have meant just 83 deaths in the US.

&gt;Although Taiwan has high-quality universal health care, its success lies in its preparedness, speed, central command and rigorous contact tracing.

&gt;Lesson #1: Be prepared

&gt;Taiwan's preparedness came largely from some hard-learned lessons from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, which killed 181 people on the island.

&gt;As a result, the island established a specialized Central Epidemic Command Center, which could be activated to coordinate a response in the event of an outbreak. In a sign of how Taiwan wanted to get ahead of the coronavirus, the center was activated on January 20, a day before the island even confirmed its first infection.

&gt;Because its authority was already established, the center was able to implement stringent measures without being slowed down by lengthy political processes. It put more than 120 action items into place within three weeks, according to a list published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). That list alone could serve as a manual on exactly what to do during an outbreak.

&gt;Lesson #2: Be quick

&gt;Taiwan's action came well before its first Covid-19 infection was confirmed on January 21. Three weeks before, within days of China's first reported case to the World Health Organization (WHO), Taiwanese officials began boarding and inspecting passengers for fever and pneumonia symptoms on flights from Wuhan, the original epicenter of the virus in China. The island issued a travel alert for Wuhan on January 20, and two days later, still with just a single case, officials began updating the public in daily briefings.

&gt;A week after its first case, Taiwan began electronic monitoring of quarantined individuals via government-issued cell phones, and announced travel and entry restrictions, mostly targeting China's Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. Just about every day after until the end of February, the government implemented new measures to keep the virus at bay.

&gt;Taiwan had only 329 cases when it imposed strict social distancing measures on April 1. In comparison, there were already 335 deaths and more than 3,000 cases on March 20, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that pubs and restaurants were to close, and that most children would be pulled from schools and nurseries. And as the UK is not testing widely, the true number of infections is believed to be much higher than official figures show.

&gt;

&gt;Lesson #3: Test, trace and quarantine

&gt;Authorities carried out widespread testing and tracing the contacts of infected people, putting them all under quarantine. It proactively tested anyone who got off cruise ships and even retested people diagnosed with influenza or pneumonia, to make sure they hadn't been misdiagnosed and were infected with coronavirus.

&gt;Lesson #4: Use data and tech

&gt;""A coordinated government response with full collaboration of its citizenry [was] combined with the use of big data and technology,"" associate professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine, Jason Wang, told CNN. Wang has also studied public health policy and co-authored the JAMA report on Taiwan's response.

&gt;Taiwan merged national health insurance data with customs and immigration databases to create real-time alerts to help identify vulnerable populations.

&gt;""Having a good health data system helps with monitoring the spread of the disease and allows for its early detection. When someone sees a physician for respiratory symptoms, the national health insurance database will have a record of it. It is easier to track clusters of outbreaks,"" Wang said.

&gt;Taiwan used mandatory online reporting and check-ins for 14 days after travel restrictions. It also employed ""digital fencing"" for close to 55,000 people in home quarantine, where alarms would sound if a quarantined person wandered too far from home. The technical surveillance methods used in Taiwan and by other governments have raised privacy concerns from civil society groups.

&gt;Iceland

&gt;Getting a coronavirus test in many countries can be near impossible, unless you're already very ill. Not so in Iceland, where anyone who wants a test gets one. Widespread testing has been crucial to the country's low number of infections and deaths, authorities there say. Only around 1,700 people have been infected in Iceland, and only eight have died.

&gt;Lesson #5: Be aggressive

&gt;Iceland's response to the coronavirus hasn't been particularly innovative. It's just been meticulous and quick. Like Taiwan, its speed has meant it hasn't had to be too restrictive -- people can still meet in groups of up to 20, if they stay two meters away from each other. While universities are closed, schools and nurseries are still open, allowing more parents to work.

&gt;""From the beginning, since we diagnosed our first case, we worked according to our plan. Our plan was to be aggressive in detecting and diagnosing individuals, putting them into isolation, and to be very aggressive in our contact tracing. We used the police force and the healthcare system to sit down and contact trace every newly diagnosed case,"" Iceland's chief epidemiologist Thorolfur Gudnason told CNN.

&gt;""We are finding that above 60% of new cases are in people already quarantined. So that showed that contact tracing and quarantining contacts was a good move for us,"" Gudnason said.

&gt;Lesson #6: Get the private sector involved

&gt;In a public-private partnership between the National University Hospital of Iceland and biotech company deCODE Genetics, Iceland designed tests early and expects to have tested 10% of its population by the end of this week. It aims to test just about everyone and has already become a valuable laboratory for the world to learn more about the novel virus.

&gt;Recent revelations that 50% of the people who tested positive in a lab in Iceland showed no symptoms at all, for example, has prompted other countries to take firmer action through social distancing, as they begin to realize preventing the virus' spread will be more challenging than initially thought.

&gt;Kári Stefánsson, CEO and director of deCODE Geneticsm, told CNN that as of Monday, it had found 528 mutations of the coronavirus in mass testing in the community. These mutations could give insight to how lethal the virus becomes and offers important data to the world to better understand how it operates.

&gt;Lesson #7: Act preventatively

&gt;Icelandic Health Minister Svandís Svavarsdóttir has emphasized speed as a powerful tool, saying the approach is to stay ""ahead of the curve."" The country appears to have done just that. After just six imported cases were confirmed on March 3, Iceland immediately issued quarantine measures for all travelers returning from Italy, and increased travel restrictions in the following weeks.

&gt;The National Police Commissioner declared a state of emergency on March 6, when the first two community-transmitted infections were confirmed. This sent a signal to government bodies to improve their preparedness, but it kept public gatherings as they were, only warning vulnerable people to stay away from crowded places.

&gt;The country closed universities and junior colleges on March 13 and banned gatherings of more than 100 people on March 16, when it had just 61 confirmed cases and not a single death."

&gt;President Trump

&gt;on Wednesday threatened to use his executive power to force both chambers of Congress to adjourn if the Senate did not confirm his nominees for vacancies across the administration.

&gt;The president, during a coronavirus briefing in the Rose Garden, offered a lengthy diatribe against what he described as congressional obstruction and argued confirming his nominees was more urgent than ever amid the pandemic.

&gt;""The Senate should either fulfill its duty and vote on my nominees or it should formally adjourn so I can make recess appointments,"" Trump said. ""We have a tremendous number of people that have to come into government. And now more so than ever before because of the virus and the problem.""

&gt;Lawmakers in both chambers are not expected to return to the Capitol until May 4 but both the House and Senate have been conducting pro forma sessions in the meantime. Those sessions prevent Trump from making recess appointments. 

&gt;""The current practice of leaving town while conducting phony pro forma sessions is a dereliction of duty that the American people can not afford during this crisis,"" he said. ""It is a scam, what they do. It’s a scam. And everybody knows it and it’s been that way for a long time.""

&gt;Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution grants Trump the power to ""on extraordinary occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in case of disagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper.""

&gt;That means that in order for the president to step in and dismiss both, the GOP-controlled Senate would have to adjourn while the Democrat-held House objected. Senate Democrats also have procedural tools to prevent the Senate from adjourning. 

&gt;The National Constitution Center noted that ""no President has ever exercised"" the authority.

&gt;""Perhaps it’s never been done before, nobody’s even sure if it has,"" Trump said. ""But we’re going to do it. We need these people here. We need people for this crisis, and we don’t want to play any more political games.""

&gt;Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law professor who appeared as a GOP witness during the House impeachment hearings, warned Trump against taking the step. 

&gt;""The President just said that he may unilaterally adjourn Congress. ... This power has never been used and should not be used now,"" he tweeted.

&gt;Senate Republicans were expected to set up another three weeks of pro forma sessions on Thursday afternoon to last through the chamber's new May 4 return date, after that date was pushed back because of the coronavirus. 

&gt;Spokesmen for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell

&gt;(R-Ky.) didn't immediately say if Trump's comments changed the GOP plan, or if Republicans would now try to pass an adjournment resolution by unanimous consent sparking a fight with Democrats.

&gt;Instead, a spokesman for the GOP leader said McConnell spoke with Trump on Wednesday about ""Senate Democrats’ unprecedented obstruction of the president’s well-qualified nominees and shared his continued frustration with the process."" 

&gt;""The Leader pledged to find ways to confirm nominees considered mission-critical to the COVID-19 pandemic, but under Senate rules that will take consent from Leader Schumer,"" the spokesman added.

&gt;The Trump administration has long been plagued by vacancies across the government. Trump has declined to nominate full-time appointees to key positions, instead relying officials in acting capacities.

&gt;One hundred and fifty of 749 ""key positions"" tracked by The Washington Post and Partnership for Public Service do not have nominees, while another 15 are awaiting nomination.

&gt;The Department of Homeland Security, a key agency in guarding against the coronavirus and other national security threats, has not had a full-time secretary in over a year. A number of other top positions in the department remain unfilled.

&gt;Trump cited the director of national intelligence, two members of the Federal Reserve Board, the undersecretary of agriculture responsible for administering food security programs and the head of the U.S. Agency for Global Media as nominees he has put forward who are awaiting confirmation amid the pandemic.

&gt;Rep. John Ratcliffe

&gt;(R-Texas), nominated to be the director of national intelligence, has not yet received a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Judy Shelton, one of Trump's Federal Reserve Board nominees, has not yet received a vote before the Senate Banking Committee, after hitting early skepticism from GOP members of the panel. 

&gt;Trump's comments are likely to pour new fuel into the fight over nominations, which have emerged as a lightning rod in recent years. Senate Republicans went ""nuclear"" in 2019 to change the Senate's rules and cut down on the amount of time it takes to confirm most executive nominees and district judges. But Democrats are still able to force McConnell to eat up days of floor time for a single nomination under the chamber's rules. 

&gt;Trump touted the number of judicial nominations, a top priority for McConnell, confirmed by the Senate: 193. But he argued that nominees for the executive branch were stuck in limbo for up to years because Democrats were ""holding this up."" 

&gt;""It's a very unfair system,"" Trump said. ""There's no time for anybody else and many of these people have been waiting for two and a half years. ...We can't get them approved by the Democrats. ...It's just a concerted effort to make life difficult."" 

&gt;It's unclear what prompted Trump to levy his attack on the congressional confirmation process on Tuesday, but it marked the latest instance of the president using his coronavirus briefings to take up political fights as his White House comes under criticism for its handling of the pandemic.

&gt;Coronavirus has infected roughly 635,000 people in the U.S. and killed roughly 28,000.

&gt;He has previously chastised presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden

&gt;during briefings, described Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer

&gt;(D-N.Y.) as a ""lightweight"" and warned lawmakers against conducting ""partisan investigations"" after the House convened a special committee to exam the federal response to the pandemic.

&gt;Trump has also used the briefings to push other proposals in line with his broader agenda. He rolled out increased narco-terrorism patrols earlier this month and announced on Tuesday that his administration would put a hold on funding for the World Health Organization (WHO), accusing it of being too trusting of China.

Under-reported (de facto censored) by our corporate mass media system is that the NYC hospital system broke down. At times some hospitals were literally turning sick patients away telling them that they weren't sick enough to be admitted to the overflowing hospitals.

So the sick people went home and died at home.

Now that the infection rates are stabilizing the overstretched EMT and coroners are collecting bodies of people that died at home -- *that* is the cause of much of the increase in death numbers.

Also, if a person is sick from cancer or heart problems or whatever, and they get COVID-19 and it pushes them over the edge and they die, shouldn't that be counted as a COVID-19 death?

That's life here in the ""land of the free"" where the mass media covers things up with happy talk.

Now as things have leveled off in NYC, the dead that died at home are slowly being counted. Yesterday's death toll from the virus was *huge* due to this dynamic.

That's why traitor Trump decided to do a classic distraction technique and to cut funding to the WHO -- today everyone's talking about that inflammatory act and not the massive spike in the death toll.

The Wu Han laboratories were working with the covid-19 virus before the outbreak, and there's some suspicion that it got out through an infected worker, although it also just could have been out there in the first place and spread through no fault of the labs.

Maybe if China had alerted the world and been more transparent to begin with it could have been contained better, but you know what? We humans create the conditions that allow such pandemics to spread.

The West is being affected because unlike the Asian countries that adopted policies years ago to mitigate their spread, we tend to ignore even the possibility that we'll be affected and are slow to react when we are. Some countries also have idiots running them.

We need to adapt and overcome, and that happens once it becomes clear we, too, are at risk. 

Wash your hands, keep them away from your face, wear a mask and practice physical distancing. Pretty simple, just need to become a widespread, common social change.

There really is no choice here.  Compared to the rest of the world, we have 30% more deaths from COVID than the average.  We were one of the last hit and should have been the most prepared.

If we consider that we should have been 30% below the worldwide average, he's personally responsible for 15,000 so far.  All to profit more.  And that's just a small sample of his crimes thus far.

Would each state decide when it opens up? This would be consistent with each state deciding whether to shut down, with the federal government under President Timid trying to avoid any semblance of responsibility or nationwide decision-making.

At the moment there are only 2 states with few than 300 cases, and only one with no reported COVID-19 deaths so far, but opening up Wyoming and Alaska may not do much for the national economy.

There there are states with governors who've shown substantial reservoirs of idiocy, e.g., Noem in South Dakota who continues to refuse to impose statewide stay at home orders. SD cases per capita are now higher than Florida. In states applying piecemeal ad hoc approaches, it may not be safe for the whole state to reopen until late July.

More practically, how would, say, California prevent South Dakotans from entering California since it's unlikely the do-nothing Trump administration would apply border controls at South Dakota's borders with neighboring states?

As for county by county, as yet there are no cases in Modoc and Lassen counties in California, which isn't surprising because they lack ski resorts or any other winter tourist attractions; they're cattle ranch country with some fishing streams. Will they remain case-free when the weather warms, and people from Reno-Sparks head north on US 395 to go fishing? We're also talking some of the sparsest populated parts of California with damn few hospitals.

On a different tack, San Bernardino county in California is the largest single county in the US outside Alaska. It has greater area than 9 states. Most of it is the Mojave desert, and that part of it is nearly case-free. However, it's southwest corner has the city of San Bernardino and is part of the greater Los Angeles metro area, and that's where most of its cases are, though there are some others in Victorville and Barstow. Does it make sense to manage this county as a county?

Finally, would any ***safe*** counties have interstate or US highways running through them? If so, how would they remain safe if truckers traveling between unsafe counties went though them? Truckers would need to remain in their cabs? No self-serve gas, er, diesel? Attendants in hazmat gear collect payment from truckers? Where would truckers, er, relieve themselves?

And he was right.

Sure, the DNC pulled some shit because they were convinced America was ready for it's first female President. And the popular vote proved that most of America was, but the minority that wasn't simply played dirty on a massive scale.

If the 10% of Bernie supporters who protested by voting for Tump or the random voters who threw away their votes on Jill Stein had held their nose and voted for Hillary, we wouldn't have this whole Trump mess. We'd still have McConnell trying to deadlock everything, but at least we'd have a more balanced Supreme Court. And we'd already be on the recovery from Covid-19 instead of heading deeper into it with a $2 Trillion blank check, among many other things...

At this point, we have to take the White House and Senate and increase our House majority if we have any hope of making meaningful change. Biden isn't necessarily the long-term answer, but four more years of Trump's lunacy will completely squash any progress towards the ideals that we've all been fighting for.

We need to massively overwhelm all their election fraud and voter manipulation by simply outvoting every Republican at the polls. And 2018 proved that we can do it, if we all pull together.

So instead of turning your justified stubbornness against Biden (just like they want you to do), turn it instead towards defeating Trump and the GOP so that we can all start moving forward.

So vote against Trump no matter what, and fill the down-ballot with as many progressive candidates that you can. Then do it again in 2022, and then we can look towards 2024 and beyond.

But if TЯump and Company manage to steal another election, then things will only get worse for everyone, and progressive progress will not only stop, but entirely revert.

He is dumb, needs-to-be-liked, narcissist.  Dumb to the point he's easily influenced by whomever is immediately around him.  My insight came from reading *Bob Woodward's Fear - Trump in the White House*.

That's why; when Ivanka says ""Daddy, my friend Kim and Kanye want you to do something about prison sentences"" he does.  When Jeff Bannon says ""Ban travel to these countries"" he does.  When John Bolton says ""Support Saudi in Yemen"", he does.

I think if you can convince Trump that the will of the people is the 'coolest' thing to do at the moment, he would.  However he's being directed towards these WWE style conservative arena conventions.  He was drafted by the Republicans, he's their man.

That's a moronic statement IMO. Trump is a greedy narcissist, sure. He's bad to the point of being evil -- doubly sure. His actions which caused the US to be left wide-open for this pandemic, and then his delays and playing politics with the virus in its early stages are all clear signs of being bad or evil.

Just a month ago Donald Trump was still insisting that Covid-19 was a trivial issue, comparing it to the “common flu.” And he dismissed economic concerns; after all, during flu season, “nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on.”

But pandemics come at you fast. Since Trump’s blithe dismissal, something like 15 million Americans have lost their jobs — the economic implosion is happening so quickly that official statistics can’t keep up.

In our last economic crisis the economy shrank around 6 percent relative to its long-run trend, and the unemployment rate rose around five percentage points. At a guess, we’re now looking at a slump three to five times that deep.

And this plunge isn’t just quantitatively off the charts; it’s qualitatively different from anything we’ve seen before. Normal recessions happen when people choose to cut spending, with the unintended consequence of destroying jobs. So far this slump mainly reflects the deliberate, necessary shutdown of activities that increase the rate of infection.

As I’ve been saying, it’s the economic equivalent of a medically induced coma, in which some brain functions are temporarily shut down to give the patient a chance to heal.

Paul Krugman’s Newsletter: Get a better understanding of the economy — and an even deeper look at what’s on Paul’s mind.

While a deep slump is unavoidable, however, good policies could do a lot to minimize the amount of hardship Americans experience. The problem is that the U.S. political landscape has long been dominated by an anti-government ideology that left us unprepared, intellectually and institutionally, for this crisis.

What should we be doing? Serious economists have already reached a rough consensus over the appropriate policy response to a pandemic. The bottom line is that this isn’t a conventional recession, which calls for broad-based economic stimulus. The immediate mission, beyond an all-out effort to contain the pandemic itself, should instead be disaster relief: generous aid to those suffering a sudden loss of income as a result of the economy’s lockdown.

It’s true that we could suffer a second round of job losses if the victims of the lockdown slash spending on other goods and services. But adequate disaster relief would address this problem, too, helping to sustain demand.

So it’s all about helping the economic victims of the coronavirus lockdown. How are we doing?

The good news is that thanks to Democratic pressure, the CARES Act, the $2 trillion not-a-stimulus bill that became law less than three weeks after Trump dismissed the notion that Covid-19 might pose an economic problem, is mostly focused on the right things. The core provisions of the legislation are aid to hospitals, the unemployed and small businesses that maintain their payrolls; these are exactly the kinds of things we should be doing.

What’s especially remarkable is that we got mostly sensible legislation even though the president was talking nonsense, pushing for — what else? — tax cuts as the solution for the economy’s problems. Actually, I can’t think of any other recent example in which Republicans agreed to major fiscal legislation that mainly involved spending to benefit the needy, without any tax cuts for the rich.

The bad news comes in two parts.

First, the bill falls far short of what’s needed on one crucial dimension: aid to state governments, which are on the front line of dealing with the pandemic. Unlike the federal government, states have to balance their budgets each year. Now they’re facing a surge in costs and huge revenue losses; unless they get a lot more aid, they’ll be forced to cut spending sharply, which will directly undermine essential services and indirectly deepen the overall slump.

And it’s not clear when or whether that hole will be filled. Senate Republicans are hostile to the idea of another rescue package; White House officials are reportedly still talking about tax cuts.

Second, decades of hostility to government have left us poorly positioned to deliver even the aid Congress has voted. State unemployment offices have been underfunded for a long time, and red states have deliberately made it hard to apply for benefits. So the surge in unemployment is overwhelming the benefits system; Congress may have voted disaster relief, but the money isn’t flowing.

The loan program for small businesses is also, by all accounts, off to a shambolic start. And those $1,200 checks everyone is supposed to get? Many Americans won’t get them for weeks or months.

It doesn’t have to be like this. Canada has already set up a special web portal and phone system to provide emergency unemployment benefits. Germans have been pleasantly surprised by how quickly aid is flowing to the self-employed and small businesses.

But decades of conservative attacks on the idea that government can do anything good have left America with a unique case of learned helplessness. And this is combined with utter lack of leadership from the top.

We know what we should be doing in terms of economic policy, and Congress passed a relief bill that, while flawed, was better than I expected. But right now it looks as if our response to the economic emergency will fall far short."

With today's news being the White House did *revisionist history* and changed their web site after Jared Kushner put his foot into his mouth in front of the camera yesterday -- the horror show that is the Trump administration keeps generating negative news.

Many were shocked to learn that Trump put Kushner in charge of the White House pandemic response team.

Not a public health expert. Not a doctor -- but Trump's own son-in-law! Jared Kushner, the idiot clown who designed the Israeli-Palestinian ""peace plan"" that the entire world -- Palestinians, Europeans, you name it! -- openly laughed at. And that inexperienced kid was who Trump put in charge.

We need a **second bill to impeach** Trump and to bounce him out of office to get some competent leadership in DC.

2193,2193,1585947283,"&gt;  the statistics seem to be overwhelmingly in favor in Trump.

Fantasy. Trump was rejected by the popular vote of ""we the people"" in 2016 -- a simple fact.

Since the discriminatory Electoral College put Trump into the White House for 3 solid years *Trump has never had a mainstream public opinion poll showing that a majority of the American people support him as president* -- think about that astounding fact!

We can logically and honestly conclude: **Trump has never had a mandate to rule from 'we the people'**.

Trump got a boost when Covid-19 first hit. His approval rating went up to its highest  -- 49%!

But now as Americans die at 1000+ per day and as it is more and more clear how Trump alone left the US unprepared for this long-predicted pandemic, [Trump's approval rating has started to go downward](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/03/poll-majority-of-americans-now-disapprove-of-trumps-coronavirus-response-162854) again."

A different, unrelated article:

&gt; However, it’s important to note that __no supplement will cure or prevent disease.__

&gt; With the 2019 coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, it’s especially important to understand that no supplement, diet, or other lifestyle modification other than social distancing and proper hygiene practices can protect you from COVID-19.
Currently, no research supports the use of any supplement to protect against COVID-19 specifically.

Trump defended the cuts saying:

&gt; ""they haven’t been used for many, many years. And if — if we have a need, we can get them very quickly. And rather than spending the money — and I’m a business person — I don’t like having thousands of people around when you don’t need them.""

&gt;You're right that the DNC's strategy of having multiple candidates, of allowing Bloomberg to buy into the election and skew it away from a progressive agenda -- all that hurt Sanders. 

I hope you're sitting down, because what I'm about to say is going to shock you. The DNC doesn't get to pick who runs. Candidates enter the race of their own volition. They also choose when they drop out. Also, Bloomberg drew support directly from Biden, which is why Biden faded when Bloomberg bought $300 million worth of ads, and why he bounced back so strongly when Democrats abandoned Bloomberg over his company's sexist culture and his racist stop and frisk policy.

&gt;I'm sad to predict that between now and November Covid-19 will rampage through the US killing hundreds of thousands -- those are the conservative numbers. Some predict over 1 million. 

I think you're right about Trump losing the next election, but I'm more optimistic about COVID-19. Those higher mortality numbers were based on the US doing nothing and allowing its medical system to be overwhelmed. But I've never seen anything like the response that we've seen to COVID-19. My company, which said they didn't have the money to buy second monitors for its employees, suddenly found enough to buy more than 1,000 laptops and send every employee home. Schools are shutting down for weeks at a time. Hospitals aren't allowing their patients to have visitors. And all this happened before my city had a single case of COVID-19.

It's going to be very bad, but we've collectively chosen, often in contradiction of the Republicans' advice, to shut down huge swaths of our economy in order to delay the spread long enough to ensure that proper care is available to everyone."

The CDC and others' models predict that Covid-19 will flood and break the US hospital system. I was recently at one VA hospital which has canceled all elective/non-critical operations on vets and switched into ""battle mode"" preparing for virus victims. Predictions are people will be turned away from hospitals and intensive care facilities -- they'll be that swamped.

The next president will have a *golden opportunity completely rewrite the US health care system.*

So who do we want doing that?

* Sanders, who will use Medicare-for-All, a system *proven* to have less fraud and be more efficient than immoral for-profit capitalist health care run by private health insurance corporations?

or

* Biden or Trump, who will use a health insurance system based on immoral, private, for-profit capitalist health care run by insurance corporations -- a system where the design and fiduciary responsibility *by law* is to generate as much money as possible for the rich owners/stockholders of the corporation?  

  It's worth noting that *no other advanced, industrial democracy in the world* runs its health care by private health insurance companies -- **none**. The world's leaders in human life expectancy *all* use socialized medicine.

&gt; During the signing of the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act last week, President Donald Trump told reporters that the nation was &amp;quot;Doing very well&amp;quot; in dealing with the COVID-19 virus, calling it an &amp;quot;Unforeseen problem&amp;quot; that &amp;quot;Came out of nowhere.&amp;quot; While the exact nature of a viral contagion cannot be exactly predicted, the U.S. Intelligence Community provided a Worldwide Threat Assessment last year explicitly warning that the country was &amp;quot;Vulnerable&amp;quot; to a large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease.

&gt; The DNI Threat Assessment was presented to Congress less than a year after the Trump administration dramatically downsized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&amp;#039;s epidemic prevention activities abroad - which were aimed at stopping future outbreaks at their source.

&gt; &amp;quot;The goal of Predict was to speed up and organize the previously haphazard hunt for zoonotic diseases - those that may jump from animals to humans. In recent years, scientists have discovered many lethal viruses lurking in wild and domestic animals,&amp;quot; the New York Times reported last year.

The unelected-by-the-American-people clown occupying the White House was impeached by the US House of Representatives -- one of only 3 presidents to suffer such a fate.

That immediately makes him a terrible president.

Trump's lies while in public office are well documented. Here's one of my favorite recent Trump lies, from March 6th:

&gt; “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…""

That lie was so blatant that VP Pence had to correct Trump's lie on the same day. To date, less than 10k Covid-19 tests have been done in the US.

When we are hearing report after report coming up in the next few weeks about Covid-19 rampaging across the US, remember this:

**In 2018 President Trump eliminated the Pandemic Response Team that was created under Obama.**

Here, you can read about that in this article: [“I Don’t Know Anything About It,” Trump Says About White House’s Elimination of Pandemic Response Team](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/i-dont-know-anything-about-it-trump-says-about-his-white-house-eliminating-the-pandemic-response-team.html)."

Oh good -- so you got to the link to the article talking about Trump shutting down the Pandemic Response Team that Obama created.

Good because that point is critical. All the sh\*t that is happening with Covid-19 falls *squarely* on Trump's shoulders.

&gt; until I got to treasonous president.

So an unelected-by-the-American-people president gets into the White House and [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQb2S4DIcNc) and [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcD5sttJ-sQ) again asks for foreign gov'ts to investigate his political rivals and interfere in US election -- and you don't consider that treasonous?

Are you telling that asking foreign gov'ts to interfere in our elections is MAGA? Or is this merely Trump protecting ""brand Trump"" so he can license his name on some more hotels and golf courses?

Are you honestly telling me that if a Democrat gets elected in 2020 and calls on Russia or China or some other country to investigate former president Trump or Mitch McConnell -- are you saying you will be fine with that?! (Because I won't be fine with it!)

Because that is the political precedent that traitor Trump and the US Senate has said is now okay. So are you fine with that?"
2260,2260,1584310839,"Our president lie?! :-) Look at some of Trump's claims about the Covid-19 crisis:

**January 22:** “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. It’s going to be just fine.”

**February 2:** “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”

**February 24:** “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

**February 25:** “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

**February 25:** “I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”

**February 26:** “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

**February 26:** “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

**February 27:** “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

**February 28:** “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

**March 2:** “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

**March 2:** “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”

**March 4:** “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to **work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

**March 5:** “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

**March 5:** “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

**March 6:** “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

**March 6:** “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

**March 6:** “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

**March 6:** “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

**March 8:** “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.”

**March 9:** “This blindsided the world.”

There was one who was good at messaging and managing things and her name was Elizabeth Warren. Her problem was that she's a habitual liar and it caught up with her. The rest of the field stunk. Eventually, with Crazy Bernie's rabid supporters appearing to be ready to steal the nomination with a plurality of voters in a crowded field, some uninspiring patriots stepped down and endorsed the guy with Alzheimer's in an attempt to stop the Communist. 

Sanders is being rejected not by ""red states"", but by Democrat voters including black voters. These aren't Republicans voting for Biden in most of these states. The Democrat party can't win the Rust Belt back without these voters. 

I intend to vote for Biden in the so-called ""Acela Primary"", if they even bother holding it. I'm not sure what will happen at this point. 

I actually thought of a ticket that might be able to beat Trump in the fall. Let there be a brokered convention with the eventual ticket being Mitt Romney for President with Elizabeth Warren for VP. That ticket would win over 60% of the popular vote and an EC landslide. Biden and Sanders can both actually lose to Trump, despite the poor initial handling of the COVID-19 crisis, because they are both exceptionally terrible candidates."

We are hopelessly low on critical medical supplies, and everyone I know who works in healthcare is terrified of how ill-prepared our hospitals are to deal with the inevitable surge of patients. These are measures that other countries prepared for well in advance, and undoubtedly reduced the impact of what is quite simply much worse than just a flu outbreak.

Now on to your next point, that because the virus is spreading despite public health measures to stop it, that these measures are pointless. I don't believe that any epidemiologist, or anyone who understands that more disease spreading is worse than less disease spreading, would agree. Without those measures, the problem will be worse, without question. It is not Trump's fault that there are Coronavirus patients within the United States. But it was a result of his administration's decisions that we reduced our ability to respond to this pandemic, and we will suffer serious consequences as a result while the President pats himself on the back, per usual, spouting the usual incoherent bullshit about a historic and greatest bigly job ever, like noone has ever seen, everyone is saying it, many good things to come (what good thing could possibly come from a viral outbreak?). 

Now, do I think Trump supporters will vote for Joe Biden because of this? No. I think it's fairly clear at this point that virtually no criticism of the President, no matter how valid, will sway much of his base.  

For the record, I despise Joe Biden. While Trump engaged in similar behavior to underage girls in the past and frequently bragged about it, Biden did so in public and on camera while in office. I am resolutely pro-2A, align with conservative thinking on most issues, and usually vote Republican. It genuinely pains me that I would even consider voting for someone like Joe Biden. But I think for myself, and I will not upend reality to worship an incompetent and blatantly corrupt reality TV star, whose only real skills are his seemingly limitless capacity to shamelessly lie, debase his office, engage in blatant corruption and chase everyone of real integrity or experience from his administration. I am frankly disgusted by his followers' willingness to excuse him, and their contentment with schoolyard insults and nicknames as a replacement for anything of political substance. Presidents are, without fail, deeply flawed individuals who often make bad decisions. The fact that so many cannot admit that about this President is disturbing when those flaws are so obvious and so public, and when he so consistently fails to put together anything resembling clear, consistent, well-constructed policy, or even allow his own appointees to do so.

It has isolation hospital rooms — located in a former Army hospital building — but they are mostly just props, with fake equipment and light switches that exist only as paint on walls.

Meanwhile, federal officials never contacted the town’s hospital, Regional Medical Center, about handling covid-19 patients, said Louis Bass, the hospital’s chief executive."

&gt; The Trump administration repatriated infected Americans over the objections of the CDC.

&gt; The federal agency that conducts the testing did not administer the test until days later because the case did not fit the agency&amp;#039;s narrow testing criteria, university officials said in a letter to the campus community late Wednesday.

&gt; The C.D.C. has restricted testing to patients who either traveled to China recently or who know they had contact with someone infected with the coronavirus.

&gt; The medical center requested testing from the C.D.C. &amp;quot;Since the patient did not fit the existing C.D.C. criteria for Covid-19, a test was not immediately administered. U.C. Davis Health does not control the testing process.""

2294,2294,1582076941,"Dude, Breitbart is pushing nonsense right now. [Here](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/18/exclusive-tom-cotton-on-coronavirus-establishment-media-spouting-chinese-communist-party-line/) is Brietbart covering for Tom Cotton's insane conspiracy that COVID-19 leaked from a Chinese lab.

Lets look at the first lie:

&gt; But since the government’s original official story about the virus’s origin is collapsing under scrutiny, the senator argued that the question needs to be asked—and that that theory, along with several other more plausible virus origin theories than the Communists’ original and likely false claim that the virus originated in a food market, need to be pursued.

The cited article is about the epidemiology, not the origin of COVID-19. There is nothing in that paper that disputes the origin of the disease.

The second lie:

&gt; “We don’t have evidence that this disease originated there but because of China’s duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says, and China right now is not giving evidence on that question at all,” Cotton said in the Bartiromo interview.

China is giving evidence. [They gave samples of the disease for sequencing, and we now know the whole genome.](https://www.bioworld.com/articles/433087-article-headline)

Third lie:

&gt; But perhaps more importantly than that, Cotton laid out how the establishment media—much of which has accused him of spreading conspiracy theories about the coronavirus—is “spouting” Chinese Communist Party propaganda.

Lets look at Cotton's full quote which Breitbart only prints part of to hide the racism:

&gt; “We don’t know where it originated, and we have to get to the bottom of that,” Cotton said. “We also know that just a few miles away from that food market is China’s only biosafety level 4 super laboratory that researches human infectious diseases.”

We know COVID-19 is likely an infection that jumped from [bats to humans](https://web.archive.org/web/20200124223105/https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.914952v2)... maybe [through a pangolin](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/coronavirus-pangolins-racism-why-conservationism-prejudice-shouldn-t-mix-ncna1136681). This is a common origin of new diseases... because bats are [amazing... disease-fluffs](https://www.livescience.com/26898-bats-host-human-infecting-viruses.html).

Tom Cotton was wrong. Tom Cotton tried to walk back his obviously ill informed statement. Brietbart is trying to say the ""main stream media"" lied... when it didn't.

They just quoted Tom Cotton's stupid ignorant comment."
