I have a few bones to pick with this. First of all they phrase taxing wealthy Americans as an ""Ask"" I don't remember being asked if I want to pay my taxes. Secondly, I do not think the tax increases should apply to anyone making $400,000 or less. That number should be more like $600,000 or $800,000 and should be adjusted based on where you live. In California $500,000/year doesn't make you rich. Third, costs of preschool being covered? I don't recall anyone having to pay for that? Next, and this is a big one, making college more affordable by increasing Pell Grant $550. For anyone who's gone to college they know that's enough for one or two books MAYBE.  It doesn't address the root cause- schools raising their tuition by absurd amount every year! Plus many people have well off parents that can't or won't help pay for school so they get screwed. The child tax credit bugs me too. $300/month isn't much to cover day care expenses. What really needs to be addressed is stagnant wages and inflation so that families can make it on a single income or simply have both parents making more money so daycare isn't such a burden. Also- the social programs in the bill are only going to last a few years. This does not equate for the amount of money they are spending. 

In general this bill is way too vague. They want to reduce carbon emissions, improve infrastructure, etc. What cities are they focusing on? Which highways? How do they plan to reduce carbon emissions? Tired of the government passing crazy expensive packages without any explanation of how this will be paid for, who's going to actually decide how and where the money is being spent, and being incredibly vague about how they actually plan to solve any of these issues.

There is no where iterated in law(other than case law) that a woman’s right to privacy and autonomy extends to another person/fetus/organism growing in her through her actions that she knowingly undertook for her pleasure. Abortion is used more as a birth control in the USA than a form of protection for an ill prepared parent. That’s a fact(before you start throwing out what if’s and rape cases), almost everyone agrees if a woman’s health or was raped/incest then it’s appropriate to warrant/allow an abortion.

101,"In early 2000s, l was a news/documentary junkie supporting social justice warrior causes all over the world. I first encountered Vice news, where it accurately reflected many honest social issues we neglect as a society. I was impressed with its accurate and honest investigative journalism. At that time, Gavin McInnes, a very multiculturally educated and entertaining individual was in charge. That's when l respected him and listened to his messages once in awhile. As a Xennial, l grew up at a time when identity politics had little extremism, open convo and diversity was respected. I know lm not a racist, and l've met plenty of all colors who were. What l do know was that he was a not a racist. Maybe a bit crude, but not a racist. I've met plenty of women and many other groups who were worse who branded me as servant for being feminine. When l first heard of proud boys, l was impressed with the diversity. It was after l also sensed porn becoming an obsession, destroying love, mutual respect, and even treatment of women with third wave feminism wanting to demolish men and nuclear family. l understood his message. So many men without strong father figures, losing their sense of identity and self esteem. A man without self esteem usually lead to abuse and npd. Lack of unity, rise of American hate was Gavin's concern who only saw America giving him opportunities to rise with his own merit, a group of men who just wanted to hang out with the boys, just like any group of women who wants to do the same. That's what l saw in proud boys. Their actions were consistent with their message. 

To the genuine racist and American haters, Proud Boys were a threat. They were confident with self esteem, key quality to truly respect women even. As much they were proud of western civilization, they just wanted to be respected as much as any other ancient cultures. 

It disgust me that the left Marxists want to falsely brand these American Patriots, who are proud to be confident men, as disgusting white or race supremacy racists when l literally saw all colors of men wanting to band together to strengthen and encourage each other. Just like women need encouragement and time alone, so do men. Many are biologically built differently in interests or subject matter. 

This is not about race or gender. This is about fragile intolerant people whose only way to feel a sense of superiority is to demolish those who actually are strong. 

I've met my share of neonazis to kkk types. They are nothing like the Proud boys. They hide in the left and right behind more honest ppl with principles to gain some credibility or not be found out, just like terrorists who hid behind the middle east population to avoid detection. Luckily, proud boys always ousted those who may have been caught. What's important is that their actions never followed the classic white supremacy org. Tell me where they have instigated any violence except the left terrorists like antifa feeling privileged to hit them, run away then accuse the proud boys that they were lynching them when they defended themselves. Proud boys are truly the victims of American haters. Antifa wouldn't have even be able to wreak this much havoc if Proud boys were truly a white supremacy group. Yes, you may meet some neonazis. Most of them are a quite small group or foreign with legit neonazi groups. Focus on them, not America. They don't deserve to be piled with Proud Boys. 

It's time to stop using American men, especially with Caucasian heritage, as scapegoats for racism committed by some ancient foreign white people. USA has always been a unique system with a unique ideology.

You can be proud of your country and heritage while also respecting others. There is no need to diss. It's just a preference any individual of all backgrounds or colors wish to support. That's what Proud boys are.

Let's stop this pathetic and sad attempt to resort to this low ball slander and destruction of an inclusive group with positive intentions. Yes maybe there are more whites in the group, bc 76% of America happens to be white still. Doesn't mean they are racist.

Maybe you were an attractive spoiled brat who had it easy due to your looks and ppl are just repulsed by your personality, bc you refuse to develop it.

115,"I'm saying collectivism is dangerous and leads to racism/entitlement of whatever identity, opposite of individuality, individual liberty. See each person for who they are than constantly grouping and fighting about ethnicity or race superiority. Nobody in this world has met everyone on every corner of earth. Nobody really knows what agenda is pushed on the media by whom. As we know ppl align by principles. So far, what challenges this idea is either identity politics or marxism-the loss of the individual. America is one of the few with that principle and it sucks bc it's been ruined as we ignored it for so long. Now if we see a corrupt Christian, will they brand every Christian as bad. If we see a bad black person, we will see all blacks as bad. That's how it eventually turns. This is the exact cancer the founding fathers wanted to avoid by pushing individual liberty as the true founding principle that leads to collective equality. 

It truly pains me now bc l feel as though l have to judge similar groups if they'll accept me by my color or whatever identity. I can't be free to voice my opinion anymore. I rarely had to live like that. Will l be judged as a racist if only date another korean guy? Will l be judged if l date a white man and seen as a poc/Asian traitor? If l support men as much as women, will l be a traitor? In America, wasn't that big of a deal. Now it's starting to. I've only faced racism or false identity politics stereotype, ironically, by democrats in the past few years. The collective whatever Asian group, the collective black group, the collective white group, the collective lgbt group. The collective atheist group. The collective hardcore feminist group. The collective anti-american group. The collective anti-korean group. The collective anti-asian group. They judge me if l don't follow the script lm supposed to follow. Now that l think about it, l can see why the left would hate me bc l refuse to tie myself in any group. All those identifies don't define my heart. All l know is that l support the pure virtues of American founding laws and principles, whether it's been exploited or not. I believe in the pure virtues of religion, pure virtues of peace from Jesus to Buddha that's also been exploited. The saddest thing is that we are at a point where we have to really consider practicing the same war, conflict, hate, fighting to eradicate the divisive hate again. Love does not eradicate hate sadly. It's taken as a weakness. Only gave the exploiters time to divide more.

You will have POC acting like this as a sign that they want to be white so many will try to not act like it or credit this to white ppl. This is the true stereotype of ""alphas"" and their families of all races that's been adopted throughout civilization. Stereotypes are more true by personality than by color with little exterior cultural nuances. Every ""alpha"" l met in the world of all races who never had much interaction with other races literally act like this. There is the same level of those who act the opposite in every race too.

211,"I'm concerned about the impact our ongoing political divide has over decades. Every four to eight, or even as little as two years, the policies of the United States can change dramatically, affecting our lives and the rest of the world as well. This is a problem above and beyond the problems that the Left has with policies of the Right, and visa versa. It is destabilizing. Further, every election season, we see this polarization in one another. We can barely understand how the other side thinks. Our elected officials so rarely reach out across party lines. The rhetoric of far Left and far Right supporters is quite harsh, not just to their opposition, but to those at the center and even moderates on their own side. Ok listen - it doesn't matter where you fall (left, right, center) or what you think America ought to be and so on . . . 
WAKE UP!!! 
You're not going to get what you want. 
If you do get what you want, it will not last for long. Soon elections will come and you will get an America with leadership you can't stand again. And this will go on destabilizing pretty much everything on the planet to some degree or another, and at any given time, about half of us Americans are going to be miserable with our government. 
--OR -- 
Let's all of us - even the more extreme among us - extend an olive branch to our fellow Americans and try to stabilize America over the next few decades. Adopt this policy. Whatever your party affiliation - let the leadership know that you want leaders towards the center. When the primary elections come, vote for a candidate who leans more to the center. In fact, if your party chooses an extremist and the opposing party chooses someone towards the middle, vote for the candidate of the opposing party! We will never get rid of Left versus Right, but for the time being, if we can't get away from division altogether, we need to reframe: It's not about Left versus Right, it's about Center versus Extreme. If you do hold to a more extreme position, you may still want to think twice before voting that way. These things tend to swing like a pendulum and the more extreme we get this election cycle, the more extreme we may get in the opposite direction the next. Be an extremist, but when it comes to elections vote towards the center as a peace offering to other Americans, and to stabilize things. You can still be an extremist. Work with people who share your extreme views to make changes in society so that more people embrace your ideas until they are not so extreme. If they're good ideas, more people will eventually accept that, and perhaps your extreme ideas will no longer seem so extreme. They will become the new center. This could be true for ideas on the extreme Left or Right, if the ideas truly merit being embraced. ",1501339388

In college we are challenged to expand our ""circle"" by learning and experiencing the world through other people's perspectives, thus expanding and reshaping our own realities. Yet many of our fellow Americans are constantly allowing our realities to be shaped by the media, politicians, and our own social networks that result in our ""circle"" to be narrowed by restricted opinions. It is great to view various opinions on a subject through many different lenses before coming to a conclusion on a subject. 

With that being said, I find this video to be extremely interesting and it provided me with a different perspective on the Putin meeting with Trump. However, regardless of the intent of President Trump, I found that his interest with Russia will be always overshadowed by the way he handled himself when asked the question regarding Russia's influence in the election. Personally, I am not a Trump supporter, but his presidency will always be an up-hill battle so long as he continues to portray his ""us versus them"" mentality within our own nation. ",1532157835

The proper way to look at these two models is as expressions of human motives. Capitalism expresses the motive of being rewarded for your efforts and Socialism expresses the motive for safety/security. Both are valid motives humans strive for simultaneously. It is NOT one or the other.

All modern wealthy nations have embraced elements of both capitalism and socialism to create mixed economies. These mixed economies are the success stories. They reflect the needs/motives of their citizens.

Of course, some countries do better than others, but the more democratic systems are usually the ones that keep thriving.

The USA has a ton of socialistic elements and was it's most socialistic after WWII. No one can deny the rise of America during the 1950s-90s. Northern Europe also rose during this time period and now arguably is better than America for the average wage earning employee.

Just because he tests people doesn't mean anything, I test people too. He’s not board certified and is falsely representing his views as some sort of expert opinion when they’re not, and are false. 

He claimed his office's results showed that the virus had spread further in the area undetected, and thus wasn’t all that dangerous. That's misguided and statistically incorrect. They should never have assumed that the patients they tested (who came for walk-in COVID-19 tests or who went to urgent care for symptoms they experienced in the middle of a pandemic) are representative of the general population. For those not in medicine, that's like estimating the average height of Americans from the players on an NBA court. 

Then he makes a bad comparison to the flu. Flu mainly kills the very young and the old, about 30,000-40,000 Americans a year die of it. Covid-19 is much more contagious, we all have some immunity to flu but no immunity to this novel coronavirus, and as a result people of all ages are winding up in the ICU, and so far 60,000 Americans have died from the virus in 120 days. In just 4 months Covid has beaten the annual death toll of the flu, and we're not done since it's projected to possibly worsen in the fall. 

This guy in the video is claiming that disinfecting and staying home weakens your immune system? Baloney. There's a theory called the Hygiene Hypothesis where if children grow up in a sterile environment they may be more likely to develop allergies in their lifetime, but that's not what he's saying. A few weeks indoors will not do this, nor will it weaken your immune system. You're still inhaling 50+ species of germs with every breath you take, even with a mask on. 

""We didn't shut down for bird flu."" That's because bird flu was successfully contained with proper source control. If it got loose in NYC, then yes we would have shut the city down. I should know, I got to view the city's crisis plans in 2010.

So he's using bad data, and then making a flawed judgement on the basis of it. If we listen to his advice, the death toll WILL spike. He's clearly biased since he's making political ranting, and not using the actual data.

Both The American Academy of Emergency Medicine and the American College of Emergency Physicians [put out a joint statement](https://www.aaem.org/resources/statements/joint-endorsed/physician-misinformation) condemning his remarks.

Vindman came to national attention in October 2019 when he testified before the United States Congress regarding the Trump–Ukraine scandal. His testimony provided evidence that resulted in a charge of abuse of power in the impeachment of Donald Trump.

Commissioned in 1999 as an infantry officer, Vindman received a Purple Heart medal for wounds he received from an IED attack in the Iraq War in 2004.[3][4] Vindman became a foreign area officer specializing in Eurasia in 2008, and assumed the position of Director for European Affairs with the NSC in 2018.

In July 2020, Vindman retired after 21 years in the military. He cited vengeful behavior and bullying by President Trump and administration officials after he complied with a subpoena to testify in front of Congress during Trump's impeachment hearings. At the time of his retirement, Vindman's promotion to the rank of colonel had been abnormally stalled by the administration.[5][6]

I'm telling you what the legal precedent is (not that I expect a bunch of emotional redditors to understand)  but this is a states right issue,  legally.  This is why Scotus once ruled that abortion cannot be outlawed,  BUT allowed the states to each craft their own laws on how abortion is limited.
